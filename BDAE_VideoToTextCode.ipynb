            "Transcription for Python If Else  If Else Statement In Python  Python Training  Edureka.mp3 :  Hello guys, this is Vasim from Edureka and I welcome you all to this session in which I'm going to talk about if else in Python. Let's start the session and take a look at the agenda. So first of all, I'm going to talk about python conditions and then I will discuss what is if and else statements in Python moving further. I will tell you the syntax with a small example and the control flow as well. After that, I will discuss shorthand if statements and finally to sum up this session. I will show you a use case with nested if else. I hope you guys are clear with the agenda and I suggest you to subscribe to a director channel for more exciting tutorials and also press the bell icon to get the latest updates from Edureka now without any further ado. Let's start this session talking about python conditions. There are a few logical conditions which are supported in Python and the reason I'm telling you about these conditions is because these conditions are used in if statements. So following are the statements that we have which is equals to in which we have two variables and we are using the equal to operator for this condition guys then we have not equal to similarly. We have less than more than and there is less than equal to and more than equal to so you will be able to understand this better when I'm showing you the example guys because when we are using life statements, it's actually a decision-making statement guys. We have like a condition. So if it is true, then we are going to execute certain commands or certain statements and if it is false, we are going to skip the execution guys. So you'll be able to understand this when we are working on the example guys. So just to show you guys what these conditions are. I have mentioned all these conditions. So now that we are on with the python conditions, let's try to understand what is if and else in Python. So if basically is a condition statement which will have a test expression and if the expression is true, then the body of the statement is executed. Similarly when the test expression is false, the execution moves to the next block which is going to be the else block guys and then it is executed anyway. So it is like a last resort in if you're talking about layman terms. So when the whole block is not executing the else block will execute. So this is all about if and else statement guys. So you'll be able to understand this better when I'm going to tell you the example or when we are going to write the examples and by charm guys and then we also have an else if or LF that we have in Python. So it is a subsequent statement with another text expression, which means that if if statement is false, the execution will move through the LF statement and if the LF statement is also false, the execution will move to the L statement. So now let's take a look at the flow diagram to understand how it works guys. So first of all, when the execution starts the test expression is going to be tested and if it's true the block will be executed, which is the if block or the body of if in this flow diagram guys or if the expression is false the execution will go to the next block which will be either another expression in the LF block or the else block. So this is how the flow works inside a if statement guys. So now that we know how it works guys, let's take a look at the syntax for if statement. So as you can see first of all, we write the if statement that is if keyword after that, we write the expression followed by a colon and after that we write the statements that we need to execute inside the if block after that. We can have an LF block or an else block similarly for all those blocks. We have to provide certain statements that we need to be executed. So this is how the syntax works guys. So now that we know how the execution works, let's start with a simple example to check if a number is even number or an odd number. So let's take it up to pie charm guys. So we are in the pie charm guys. If you don't know what pie charm is please check out of the edureka tutorials and you will be able to know what kind of an ID by charm is and how do we work on by charm? So first of all, let me just go with a simple example to check if a number is an even number or not. First of all, I'll take a number. Let's say 10 over here and I want to check if 10 is an even number or not. So I am just going to show how I'm going to write the condition. So this is a person tile operator guys. So what it's going to do it. It's going to calculate the remainder. So if it is equal to 0 so if I divide a number, let's say 10 by 2 reminder is going to be 0. So in any case if a number is an even number, it's going to show us the remainder as 0. So we are going to write the print statement over here, which is even number. Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to print another. Let's say I'm going to give another test expression. Let's say if I live and safe this X percentile to is not equal to 0 now. We know that if it the remainder is not 0 the number is going to be of course and obviously it's going to be an odd number. So we'll just print an odd number over here. And I'm going to give another let's say else statement. So if none of these conditions are true, the execution will move to the else block and it will print try again. Let's say now when I run this I'm getting the output as even number because our percentile is going to be 0 over here. So let's try the command line input guys. So I'll just write in input enter a number and when I run this again, so I have to enter a number over here. Let's say I want 20 which is an even number now. Let's try with 13 guys. It's an odd number. So we know that it's working pretty fine. But over here we can do one more thing guys. We are providing three statements here, which is not exactly necessary because we only have two conditions if it's the percentile is going to be 0 or the remainder is 0 it's even if it's not it's an odd number. That's like an obvious statement over here. So to make the program optimized or you know, efficient in a way what I'm going to do is I am going to just provide two statements over here and in the else block I'll just write odd number. So you will see the difference here now when I enter an even number, let's say 10 again. It's showing me that it's an even number. But when I run this again and I write the number as 13, it's an odd number even though it's not even testing another condition which is if the percentile is not equal to 0 but we are getting the same statement as it was getting before because we only have two conditions here. It's either going to be 0 or it's not going to be 0 so we can use the L statement over here, which is going to make our program very efficient guys. So now to understand this better, let's take a rather complex examples. So we'll try to find out if a number is a prime number or not. So let's say I give a if statement as long as it's greater than 0 if X is greater than 0 for I in let's say range and we want the range from set to 2 X. So I'll explain this later guys. Now. I'll write one more if statement. So if X percentile 2 is equal to 0 not a prime number. And else print. Prime number. So when I run this let's say I want to enter a number. So we already know that 3 is a prime number guys. So I'll just write 3 which is showing me that it's prime number to run it again. Let's try for another number. Let's say 29. So I guess 29 is also a prime number guys. All right, so I have to provide a control statement over here. So let's see how it differs. So when I once again try 29, I'm getting prime number as well. So let's try for another number. So I'll write 10 over here, which is not a prime number. Okay. I'll have to do once again. Let's put a break statement now when I run again, let's say 12, which is exactly not a prime number. So to explain this first of all, I'm providing a condition which is if statement. So first of all my condition is the number has to be greater than 0. So let's say if I provide a number, let's say minus 2 no output because it's not going to enter this block. So to explain this let's print one more condition or I'll just print over here give a positive number and when I run it again and provide the number as minus 2 so it will show me that give me a positive number as the output. So this explains things now if I'm moving into the if block when the number is greater than 0 I have one loop guys. So to know more about loops guys check out other Eddie Rekha tutorials and you will be able to understand this better than so what happens here? I have a for loop in which I have this variable I which is going to be in range to an X. So what it means is the number will be in the range from 2 until the number X. So let's say I have X is equal to 5 the range is going to be 2 3 4 and 5 so because we already know that 1 and 2 or 2 is a prime number guys or one is not so we are starting from 2 and then we have one more if condition which is saying that if X percentile 2 is equal to 0 which means that the number is divisible by another number. So which is exactly not a constraint of a prime number. So we are printing prime number over here and because we are in a loop so we have to use a control statement which is a break statement guys as soon as this is true. This is going to break or it is going to exit the block. Now we have one more statement else, which means if this is not true, which is X personnel to if the remainder is 0 it will print not a prime number else. It will print it is a prime number. So I hope you guys are clear with the concept of using if else in a statement and we I have also shown you how you can use a for loop inside this and this is a simple program. You can write to find out if a number is a prime number or not. So now that we are familiar with how we can use panels in Python, let's take a look at another approach which is shorthand if and else so I'll clear this. So what exactly shorthand if so basically you can call the shorthand if as if you're writing the statement in single line, so I'll show you guys. So what I'm going to do is I'll just take two input. So I'll write X. Now the if statement the shorthand if statement is going to take place. So what I'll do is I'll just write if X is greater than y print greater now when I execute this let's see what happens. So I'll just write the number as let's say 10 another number has eight. It is a greater number. And similarly, let's say I want to print if it's a smaller number or not. What I'll do is I'll just write. Okay, I'll have to change is so I'll just write print. Greater if X is greater than why else print smaller now when I run this I'll enter a number. Let's say 10 again and another number will be 12. So it is a smaller number. So as you can see guys, so this is an optimized way of writing a FL statement guys. So I'll say if you have like two conditions to test out or the decision-making is not a very big deal in a problem statement. So you can write it like this and similarly instead of just one statement we can use multiple statements as well. So I'm going to show you that as well. So let's say I want to get one more condition over here, which is if a number is equal to zero or not. So I'll just write if again, so in this we have multiple statements in our shorthand if else so first of all, I have a print statement which is going to print greater if X is greater than y or else it will print equal if X is equal to y or else it will print smaller. So let's execute this case. So first of all, I'll just write 10 the other number is going to be 20. So the output will be smaller and then again, the number is 10. Let's say and another number is 10 again. It is going to show equal and let's say I have a number 20 and the next number is 15. It is going to show me that it's a greater number. So this is how you can use shorthand if and else guys. So now that we are done with shorthand programs, let's take a look at the use case in which we will make a rather complex program using the nested conditional statements. So I'm going to clear all this case. So for a nested statement first of all, we have to know what a nested if else is. So basically nested statements are in which like more than one statements are present. So let's say if I have an if statement and it is saying that if X is greater than y so the nested if statement will be I'll add one more if statement and again in this I will add one more if statement. So I keep adding all these if statements and this is going to be by nested block guys to understand this let's take an example. So we'll write. Okay, let's first of all get input variable. So I'll just write enter a number here. So let's say if I have an if statement, so I'll just write if X is greater than zero. I will have an if statement. So let's say if X is less than 5 it will print less than 5 and or else it will print. Greater than 5. Now, let me have one more statement guys. Let's have an alif statement and inside this let me get one more statement if X is greater than 10. Let's say so I'll have to make it it has to be X has to be less than 10 over here. Okay. I'll have to add one and operator now. Let's say if X is greater than 10 greater than or let's say equal to as well. So I'll just print. Greater than or equal to 10 and else statement. Let's say enter a number again. So let's execute this first of all, let me get a number less than 5. So I'll just write 3 so it is showing me that it's less than 5 and let's say I want the number as 7. It is going to show me that it is greater than 5. So if the number is equal to or greater than 10, so it is going to show me that greater than or equal to 10. Now if I give the number as let's say minus 2 it is saying me that enter number again fair enough. So let's try to add a few more statements over here guys. So in this one also, let's say if X is equal to 15 print the number. Okay, not equal to let's say greater than or equal to the number is greater than 15 or let's have one more statement days. So else print the number is less than 15. So let's run it again guys and I have to enter the number. Let's say I want to enter 13. So it is showing me two outputs which is greater than or equal to 10 and the number is less than 15. So this is how the nested if a statement works guys, we can have infinite number of if statement inside of statement and you can use the and operator as well guys. So this is a simple example of using an nested if else guys. So instead of the simple statement, we can have other optimized or more efficient statements guys. So now that we are done with the nested if else program as well. I hope you guys are clear with the concept discussed in this session.

            "Transcription for While Loop In Python  Python While Loop Explained  Python Tutorial For Beginners  Edureka.mp3 :  Hello guys, this is Vasim from Edureka and I welcome you all to this session where I'll be talking about while loops in Python before moving on. Let's take a look at the agenda for this session. So first of all, I will discuss what are while loops in Python and then I will tell you about the syntax and flow control in a while loop moving further. I will discuss control statements and conditional statements in a while loop. And finally, I will sum up this session with various examples. I hope you guys are clear with the agenda and I suggest you to subscribe to Edureka for more exciting tutorials and also press the bell icon for latest updates from Edureka without wasting any more time. Let's try to understand what are while loops in Python. A while loop in Python is used to iterate over a block of codes or statements as long as the test expression is true. I user have no idea about the number of iterations that will take place during the execution. It can be used in problems where a condition or an expression needs to be satisfied in order to execute multiple statements. For example, imagine getting financial reports of the customers in a bank from year 2000 to 2010. So we can put an expression testing if the year is in fact between 2000 and 2010 and then the execution will move to the loop and calculate the report from the relevant statements that we have put inside a loop. So now that we know what exactly is a while loop. Let's take a look at a simple example to understand the syntax. But before that, let's also discuss the flow of control using flowchart guys. So the execution starts and it will check if the test expression is true or false if it is false it will exit the loop and if it is true, it will go to the body of while and execute the statements that we have provided. Now, let's take a look at the syntax as well. As you can see we have a while loop which has a test expression. So first of all the test expression has to be true only then the execution will move to the body of y and inside the body of file. We will have various statements that I'm going to show you while working on an example guys. So now that we are done with the flow of control in a while loop. Let's take a look at how we can use control statements in a while you now we're in pycharm guys. I am using the presentation mode to make it more visible to you guys. So what I'm going to do is I'll just mention a variable. Let's say I is equal to 1 and then I will have a while keyword and I will provide the test expression which is going to be as long as I is less than let's say 5. I am going to print I so I am providing this increment operator as well. So each time the execution moves through the loop it is going to have a different value. So when I execute this you can see that the output is 1 2 3 and 4. So this is my test execution guys. I'll just add is equal to also so as soon as the value of I reaches more than 5 which is going to be 6 the test expression will become false and the execution will move out of the loop. So this is a very simple example guys. This how you can actually use while loop and now talking about python control statements. So we can also use python control statements in a while loop. So there are basically two control statements which is break and continue. So break is basically a control statement which is when encountered in a loop will skip the remaining iterations and will move the execution out of the loop and similarly continue is also doing the same thing but there is one difference guys when we encounter continue in a loop the current iteration will be skipped but rest of the iterations will still be executed. So these are the control statements guys and we will also look at the example showing you the function of these two control statements. But before that let's also talk about Python conditional statements guys. So conditional statements are decision-making statements like if else and else if which is also written as LF in Python guys. So these statements have a test expression just like a while loop guys. So as soon as the statement is true the execution will move inside the blocks of let's say if or else statements and when it is false, it will move the execution to the next block. So now let's take a look at an example to understand how control and conditional statements work in a while loop guys. So let's take it up to pycharm again. Let me remove all this. So what I'll do is I'll just take one variable give it a value. Let's say one and now while X is less than is equal to 5 I am going to print X and also mention the increment operator so that we don't have an infinite loop guys. So I'll be showing you about infinite loop as well. So when I run this the output is I have an indentation error. So we'll just remove the Idents. So when I run this now I have the output as 1 2 3 and 4 and 5 as well. So to show you the walking of break statement, I'll just mention conditional statements. So if X is equal to let's say 3 what I'm going to do is I'll just break from here and let's see what the output will be. So I have 1 2 & 3 so as soon as the break statement is encountered in a loop so we have conditional statement. So as soon as X is equal to 3 it will go inside this lock which is having this break statement and it will exit the loop guys. So this is how you use a break statement inside while loop and now to show you how you can use continue. So I have just moved this statement from here and now I'll write continue and in the else statement. I will just write print X and give it one more which is X is equal to X plus 1 now, let's see what happens guys. Okay, we have two print statements. So I'll just remove this one now when I print this again, as you can see I'm getting the output as 1 2 4 and 5 the condition that is the if statement is true for the statement when X is equal to 3 and for that we have a continuous statement. So the execution will skip this iteration and instead will move to the next one. So this is how we can use a continuous statement and with this example. I have shown you how you can use the if and else statements as well inside a while loop guys. So now that we are done with this one, let's move to the next topic that we have which is an infinite while loop. So what exactly is a infinite while loop guys? So infinite while loop is when the execution does not stop what it means is the execution will go on forever like will have infinite iterations because we already discussed that when we are using a while loop, we do not actually know how many iterations are going to happen. So when you miss or when you don't give an increment operator for the test expression variable, what happens is the execution will go on forever. So let's just take an example guys. So let's say my eye is equal to let's say one and then I have a condition that say I has to be greater than 0 and for this I want to print I okay. Let's say I want it to be less than 10. So ideally looking at this program. It should stop when the value becomes 9 or exceeding the value of 10 but we don't have any increment operator over here. So let's just run this and see what the output will be. So as you can see I'm getting this infinite loop going on which has a value one only because we do not have any increment operator over here. So I'll just stop this so instead to actually get rid of this problem. I'll just write I plus is equal to 1. So what happens now it will go until 9 and as soon as value is 10 it will exit the loop because the test expression will be false. So this is how you can write infinite while loop guys. It has its own advantages and disadvantages guys. So if you want a loop to go on forever, you can just write an infinite while loop and if you don't want that just give it a increment operator and your problem will be solved. So now let's talk about the next one that we have which is a nested while loop guys. So basically nested while loop is when you declare a while loop or any other loop inside a while loop guys. So this concept of nested while loop actually looks little tricky. But in fact, it's very easy to learn guys. So I'll just take it to pie charm and show you the example where we can write a nested while loop. So ideally talking about nested loops. Let's say I have this while loop. So to make it a nested while loom what I'll do is I'll just write one more statement giving let's say I has to be less than 5. So first of all, it will check if I is less than 10 and then it will also check if I is less than 5 then what happens is it will move into this block and it will print the value of I and I'll give it increment operator as well. So let's see what happens when I run this. Okay, I have not given any value. So let's say I want this value from the user. So just write int input and let's say enter a number. Now what happens is let's run this so I have to enter number. So it has to be less than 10 to actually go inside the loop. So if I give 11 there's no result. So let's run this again. So when I give the number, let's say 10 again, it's not going to do anything because it is actually not less than 10. So when I is less than 10 and also when I is okay, let's say if I want this to be equal to 5 I have to enter a number let's say 5 only so I'm getting the value as 5 guys. So this is how you can write a nested while loop. So let's take a look at rather complex while you program guys where we will be using nested by statements. So what I do is I'll just take two variables. Let's say I which is equal to let's say 0 and J should be equal to let's say 5 now. I have to give a test expression. While I is less than 6 and while J is greater than 0. So what I'll do is I'll just print I and J and give it a increment operator as well guys. I plus 1 and J is equal to J minus 1. So let's see what happens here. So I'm getting the value as 0 5 1 4 2 3 3 2 and 4 1. So the purpose of showing you this example is actually to get to know you about how you can use a while loop inside a while loop. So we have two variables. We have two test expressions and then we have the statements inside the while loop guys. So what is happening is we have the value of I is equal to 0 first of all. So it is printing 0 and the initial value of J is equal to 5. So this is our output and then while moving into the loop. We have 1 and 4 and similarly we reach 4 and 1 so as soon as the value of J is reaching 0 it's going to end the loop or it's going to say that the test expression is false. So that's why it's not moving inside the statements to print these statements. So this is how you can write a while loop inside a while loop guys to show you the working of nested loops. Let's take another example guys. So instead of 0 now, let's take a string guys. So what I'll do is I will just take the value of J is equal to 1 and while J is greater than 0. So in this example instead of a while loop, let's just use another loop which is a for loop guys. So for let's say I in X we want to print X guys. So let's see what the output is. Okay, let's run this now. So now that we have done this we are having an infinite loop where the output is any raker again and again. So what I'll do is I'll just write J over here and we want J and I so let's run this again guys. Okay, we are getting the output like this now. We still have an infinite loop. So let's just get rid of this to stop this from being an infinite loop. What I'll do is I'll just write one more statement. So let's say if X is equal to a which is the ending string of our variable over there. So we'll just break. So let's see what happens now. We have missed the semi-colon. Okay. Now I'm getting a value like this guys now this one more thing I should do. So I'll just increment the value of J as well. Okay, so we are getting the values like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 but we are not getting the value of the string like this. So let's do one more thing guys. Okay. So what I will do here is instead of less than zero, let's take it as less than 8 and over here we have added the break statement as well. So let's run this now and we're getting the output as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and a D Ray car separately. This is how can you use a for loop inside a while loop guys. So this is an example of using a nested loop or you can say nested while loop. So I hope you guys are clear with the concept of while loop in Python guys.

            "Transcription for Python Developer Salary  Average Salary of a Python Developer in India and US  Edureka.mp3 :  Python has swallowed all its rivals in popularity and this popularity is directly proportional to moneymaking. Hey guys, welcome back to a new session from Eddie Rekha. My name is Vajiha and in this session, I'll be sharing with you the details of the average Python developer salaries. So before we begin just make sure you subscribe to our channel and hit the bell icon to stay updated with all the latest Ed Eureka videos coming back towards this session. We shall first take a look at who are Python developers and what are their job trends then we shall take a look at the average salary is drawn by these developers based on three factors, which are experience location and skill set. So without any further delays, let's get started a Python developer just like any other developer is someone who designs programs and deliver software applications, but using Python some of the most important responsibilities include writing effective code for backend components testing and debugging programs creating applications that can be integrated with the present ones Etc. The current salary trend of these developers has also remarkably increased but before taking a look at that here is a survey that reasons out why Python developers are heavily paid. Bythons popularity in 2019 is record-breaking according to Stack Overflow Python has emerged as the most questioned language leaving behind its fierce competitor JavaScript GitHub grants Python top slot in the race for popularity. So as you can see on the screen Python stands first Java is second followed by JavaScript Etc. This popularity is also a reason for the growth in job trends for Python developers. These developers are in great demand all over the world in August 2019 indeed shows about 69,000 openings for a Python developer. Most of these jobs are in sectors like web development big data machine learning data science Etc. New York City has the most number of job postings for Python developers followed by Chicago and San Francisco. So given this I know you all will be eager to know what is the average salary drawn by these developers. The average salary depends on many factors. The three most important factors are experience location and skill set. So talking about a Python developers experience an entry-level Python developer earns a minimum of 2.4 lakhs per annum the upper limit. However depends on the organizations and the skill set possessed by the developer on an average the Python developers salary at an entry level is about 5 lakhs per annum in India and about $88,000 in the US. The next level of these developers is becoming a senior Python developer and at this level the average salary comes about 8 lakhs per annum the biggest leap in salaries seen after the senior level for developers and I hope the figure on the screen makes this clear for you. Okay. So now let's move on towards the next factor, which is location salaries of Python developers also very geographically in the US the best location for a Python developer seems to be California having an average of $122,000 per year. California stands at the top of the list for best work locations for Python developer. When it comes to India the best location for a software developer with Python skills is Gurgaon having an average pay scale of 7 lakh 31,000 per year. Okay. So now moving on towards the next very important factor, which is skill set having the knowledge of Python along with other skills proves to be a very crucial factor influencing Python developer salaries according to CV compiler. The most in-demand skills preferred along with Python are AWS and Django. The average salary for a Python developer having knowledge of Django is about 6 lakhs per annum, which is much higher compared to the average seen earlier in the session. Okay. So this brings us to the end of the session. I hope you've enjoyed and learned something new in case you have any doubts or queries. Please do let me know in the comment section and I will revert to you at the earliest. Goodbye and take care. I hope you have enjoyed listening to this video. Please be kind enough to like it and you can comment any of your doubts and queries and we will reply them at the earliest do look out for more videos in our playlist and subscribe to Edureka channel to learn more.

            "Transcription for 5 Simple Steps To Install Python On Windows  Install Python 37  Python Training  Edureka.mp3 :  Hey everyone, this is an error from Eddie Rekha in this session. I'll be walking you through how you can install and set up python on Windows so you can begin coding with it and working in python guys. This session is intended to be useful for anyone who's considering to kickstart the learning about python and need some basic insight about how to go about with the installation of python. So let's begin this brief session by checking out the agenda guys. So we'll start with the introduction of python and later check out why we need to learn python guys, then we'll move on to installing python followed by that. We look at an overview of how you can set up a runtime with python and begin coding with it guys. So let's begin by checking out what python actually is guys. We already know that python is a programming language, right? Well to be more specific python is a really powerful high level object oriented language, which was created by a person called as Guido van Rossum. Well, yes, that's him. So why did he choose to name this as python guys? Well, not certainly because of the snake but it was from a TV series that Rossum used to watch. So let's get started then. I'm sure you guys are curious about why python is so popular right guys. If you can recall a few years ago people told that python was the next big thing. Well, they were right in today's situation. It is the big thing guys. So let's check it out. Well for starters, we all feel a bit let down or lagging when we start learning new languages, right? So whether you're a beginner or a pro well, it's maybe because of all of the sheer concepts or something that confuses you or you don't understand something well in my personal opinion python solves all of my headaches with the languages that I have learned and if I had to start with the language from scratch, I would choose python for sure guys. No two doubts about that. Why well because it is very beginner friendly and the syntax is extremely simple to read and follow through guys. Well, this definitely makes us all happy and surely. Yes, python has millions of happy learners across the globe. Well, I can't begin to tell you how fun it is to work with python and now that we know what python is. Let's take a quick look at why you should consider learning python. Well guys python is a general-purpose language, but it has a wide range of applications ranging from web development scientific and Mathematic computing and even designing your own graphical user interfaces. So you can make use of Django and bottle for web development. You can make use of numpy and simpy for mathematical computations and you can design your own games using by game as well and so much more guys and also the syntax of the language is really really clean and the length of the code is relatively short. It's fun to walk in python because it allows you to think about the problem rather than focusing on the syntax itself guys and every fortune 500 company that exists today uses python in one way or the other guys. You don't even have to do any digging to know this fact. And again, as I said python is extremely popular among both the startups and established industry giants and programming in python is definitely fun guys. It's easier to understand and write python code again. Why because the syntax feels natural guys and on that note let us come to the main agenda of the session which is to help you all to install and set up python. Let us begin. So guys to begin with and install python the easiest way is to come to the official documentation page and go about from there. So here I have opened up the official python.org page and we are in the download section of the page as you can check the URL. We are at python.org slash downloads slash Windows guys since this tutorial is mainly focused on installing python to Windows we are here guys just in case if you had to install on Linux or something the steps are quite different from what we do for Windows. However, coming back the latest Python 3 version releases python 3.7 point 2 and the latest python 2 releases 2.7 point 1 5 well based on your requirement and your needs at this point of time. You should already know which version of python that you should use and just in case if you don't you can actually install both of these versions python 2 and python 3 into your machine and go about from there as well guys. Well as you can check out 3.7 point 2 is the latest version of python at the time that this session was curated guys. So basically we need to go and download this from the official site. Well, all you need to do is click on the latest release version there and take you to the download section guys. However, the first section is actually all of the changes and the new features added in python 3.7 and there are multiple documentations here as well. So basically this is all the changelog of this particular version of python guys. Well, all you need to do at this point of time is to scroll down to the file section and then search for Windows out here. Well, as you can see there are multiple versions to install, right? So you actually get an embeddable zip file, which is actually a zip file where you have to unzip it and then install it manually or you actually have an executable installer guys. And if you can notice there are two versions here as well. One is the 32-bit version and the other one is 64-bit version guys. Well, basically you need to know if your machine is either running a 32-bit version of Windows or a 64-bit version of Windows guys, but however do know that the 32-bit version is actually backwards compatible with 64-bit as well. So what I mean by that is in case if you have a 64-bit machine you can still go ahead and install python 32-bit and it would work absolutely fine. But if you have a 32-bit Windows, then you will not be allowed to install the 64-bit version guys. I hope I'm clear with that and now that you would be familiar with your particular version of Windows both are actually of the same installer as well. Well as soon as you go ahead and download it and basically all you need to do is open it later guys giving it administrative privileges is a choice, but then it is always recommended. So as soon as you run it as an admin, you'll be greeted with the following screen guys. So basically it is telling you the python version right now and it is automatically selected 64-bit version for my machine guys. So basically you can actually customize the installation at this point. You can choose the location and the features you need as well and all of that one main thing that I want you guys to do is that make sure that this particular option is checked. It says add Python 3.7 to the path. I will let you know why this is really important, but just make sure to check this at this point guys and all you need to do is hit install now and Python is ready in your machine guys. Well, basically as you can already see that it says that a program called idle is also installed with it, right? So idle is nothing but a graphical user interface, which is used to work with Python guys. So let me quickly open up idle to show you what it actually is. Well, as you can check out it is basically a Python 3.7 shell guys. So here you can actually type out anything that you want. So let us say print. Hello, Ed Eureka. As soon as I hit enter that is executed right? So basically you can run any of the Python programs here as well. So let me go ahead and do another X equal to 10 print X into 2. So X into 2 is basically 10 into 220 and that is good, right? So it basically provides a GUI for Python guys as simple as that but do know that if you actually have a Windows machine, there is a very good chance that Python might already come installed in your machine guys. However, there is one more thing that you need to do. Well, that is to actually check out your environment variable guys. So basically you need to right-click on my computer and go to properties guys and in properties. You need to go to advanced system settings and environment variables and here you need to check the path of the user variable actually points to your Python installation location guys. So this is basically why we had to have the checkbox during the installation. Well, if this is not the case and you have to manually come here and add the path in the system variable guys. So why is this required? I'm pretty sure you guys could have already guessed it at this point, but let me quickly go ahead and show you a demo. Let me open up my command prompt and if Python is in my path as soon as I hit Python it is supposed to open up the interpreter and be ready for me to execute commands guys. And since I already have the path established it is actually done. So it is as simple as this guys. Well installing Python is actually pretty straightforward and simple but let me quickly push you on another concept, right? Well, so next up on this session, we'll actually check out the different development environments available for Python guys. Well, Python has a large supporting community and there are numerous active forums online which can be handy if you're stuck anywhere guys. Well at Edureka, we have a vast community for Python lots blogs and these amazing videos created by our subject matter exports as well. So make sure to check them out. All right, so we have multiple development environments for Python guys. So we have PIDAR for Eclipse. We have by charm. We have notepad plus plus and bluefish for you all Mac users as well. We have Komodo and WIMP to guys. These are some of the many IDs that's out there that you can develop code in. Well, I suggest you use something that you're comfortable with and then go from there guys. Well choosing an IDE is like choosing an ice cream flavor. You need to first try it out practically and see if it suits your need perfectly if it does then go ahead and make use of it guys. Well, personally in my case, it has been a long journey with Python guys. I have tried multiple IDs and I have a personal liking towards by charm. It is really simple and amazing to work with and I'm sure a majority of the entire community agrees with me when I say that by charm is the number one ID for Python guys. Well, I got a lot of requests from you guys to push out a pie charm tutorial. I actually have a full tutorial on how you can actually begin using by charm. I'll leave a link in the description box below. So make sure to check it out guys. And on that note, let me quickly conclude this short session for you guys. So we started out by checking a quick introduction to Python later. We checked out why we need to consider learning Python and lastly we checked out how simple and easy it is to install and set up Python on Windows guys. Also, it is at this point of time. I would like to mention that I have curated an in-depth python tutorial just for you guys the link to this can also be found in the description box below. So make sure to check that out as well. So that is it for the small session guys. I hope you took away some real good points from here and that this helped you kickstart your python learning. So thank you guys.

            "Transcription for Variables & Data Types In Python  Python Tutorial For Beginners  Python Programming  Edureka.mp3 :  Hello everyone. This is was seen from Edureka and in this session we will be focusing on variables and data types in Python. So let's take a look at the agenda for this session. First. I'll be giving you a brief introduction to Python followed by a few applications of Python programming language moving Further we will talk about the rules and regulations that we have to follow while declaring a variable after we are done with that. We will talk about various variable data types that we have in Python and we will also run a few examples in the Jupiter notebook as well. And finally, I will sum up this session with type conversion. I hope you're clear with the agenda. So let's quickly move on to introduction to Python. Python is a general-purpose programming language which has become so popular among the developers nowadays. So let's understand what makes Python unique or what has made it popular among the developers. First of all Python is a high-level interpreted language, which means it does not require any compilation just like PHP or JavaScript. I can has a very clear syntax and readability which has made Python very easy to learn. It is almost as easy as writing a program in simple English language. Everybody can learn Python even children going to school can learn Python. It is that easy. We can use Python as an object-oriented programming language or we can also use it as a procedure oriented language as well. One more thing with Python is that we can run it on different platforms. For example, we can run it on Windows. We can run it on Linux. We can run it on Mac as well. Now, let's suppose you're writing a program in Java and you have to write 50 to 60 line of codes. But what if I tell you you can do the same thing in Python with lesser line of codes maybe 10 or 15 line of codes. Yes, it is possible and this has given Python and edge over other programming languages. And that is the reason why people are switching over to Python because they don't want to put effort into development of complex programs. They want to put the effort at the implementation part and that is where Python actually delivers. Now, let's talk a little about the history of Python. It was created in 1991 by a Dutch guy named guide of one Rossum. It has a rather funny story attached to its name also. So our creator here was very fond of a comedy series called Monty Python. So therefore the name has come from over there. Now, let's talk about a few applications. I have listed for you guys. Let me tell you guys we have web frameworks in Python. For example, we have Django or we have flask as well, which we can use for server-side web development. We also have a wide variety of Python libraries at our disposal which we can use for general purposes. For example, we have a TK inter Python library that we can use for GUI based desktop applications or for software development as well with the easy syntax that we have in Python. We just have to focus on the creativity part. We don't have to worry about making any mistakes in the syntax or any of that sort. We can also use Python for databases to update or modify the value in the database. For example, we have my SQL which is the most popular open source database which we use for storing the Python data as I've already told you guys Python is an interpreted language. So what it means is it does not require any compilation which makes it perfect for scripting. We can write long Python scripts for code reusability and automation of task. We can also use Python for prototyping. For example, we have a numpy library which is written in C programming language, but we can use it in Python to fast things up. And finally, we can also use Python in big data as well for its inbuilt features and easy access. For example, we have pandas matplotlib and scipy libraries, which we can use for scientific computations or for statistics or we can use it for data visualization or data analysis and we can use pandas for as little as loading a file into the program. So this was all about introduction to Python and its applications. So let's quickly move on to variable declaration. First of all, we have to understand what a variable is a variable is like a memory location where you store a value now this value you have stored. You may or may not change in the future now coming back to Python to declare a variable. We just have to assign a value to it. You don't have to give any additional commands unlike the programming languages like C C++ Java where you have to give additional commands for declaration and assignment purposes. Let's take a look at an example here. We have two variables X and Y and we have assigned values to each of them. We have given 100 to X and a Dureka to Y. So this is actually how you create a variable in Python. Now when I print these variables, I am going to get the output as hundred and a Dureka. You can also perform operations on these variables using the arithmetic operators. You can perform addition multiplication subtraction or division as well. Now, let's try to understand this in the Jupiter notebook as well. First of all, what I'm going to do is I'm going to declare a variable without assigning a value to it. Let's see what happens. It is going to show an error the error says name X is not defined. So let's try again after giving it a value. Let's say X is equal to 10. It does not give any errors now. So we have successfully declared a variable here. Let me declare one more variable. Okay, I'll give it a value 12. Now, let's try to perform a few operations on these variables. First of all, let's just perform addition between X and Y. Now, let's try to do multiplication. There's one more thing. I want to tell you about variable declaration that is variables in Python are case sensitive meaning an uppercase letter here is not going to be the same as a lowercase letter. They are going to be two different variables. Let me show you it is showing another error which is saying name Y is not defined because we have not assigned a value to uppercase letter Y. Let me give this another value here. Let me give it 20. So we have declared two variables here a lowercase value Y and uppercase value Y which are going to be two different variables. So we have understood here the variable declaration how we declare a variable now, let's quickly move on to various variable data types that we have in Python depending upon the properties they possess there are mainly six data types in Python. First one is the numbers or numerical data type. The next one is the string then we have a list after that we have a dictionary followed by a tuple and in the last we have a set there is one more variable data type that is range. We will talk about that in the end because it is mainly used when we are iterating through values or when we are using the for loop. So let's try to understand all these in detail numbers or numerical data types mainly have numerical values and in numbers also we have four different data types that is integer float complex and Boolean. So integer mainly takes the whole number values without any decimal point values. But if I add a decimal point value to a number it is going to become float and for complex. We just use J as an imaginary part and add it to the number for Boolean it only returns a true or a false. So we use Boolean for only categorical output. Now, let's try to understand this in Jupiter notebook. First of all, let me declare a variable X and give it an integer value. Let's say 10 now to check the type of a variable. I am going to use the type function. So it is going to show me the type of this variable. Let's say X that is int now if I add a decimal point value to X, let's say 10.25 and let's check the type of this variable. Now we should get float as you can see. We are getting float here now to make a number complex. I'm just going to add an imaginary part that is J here. Let's check the type of this variable. It is going to show complex number to understand the Boolean variable. Let me take another variable. Now. I'm going to check if 10 is greater than 9 or not. So when I check the type of this variable here, it is going to show me that it is a Boolean and when I print this value, it is either going to show me true or false since 10 is greater than 9 it is showing true as output. So this was all about numerical data types. Now, let's quickly move on to string data type string data type in Python is written in single or double quotes as you can see here in the example that I have shown you I have two variables X and Y and I have given them the string values. Hello and world now to access the string values. We use the square brackets with the index number. Now, you must be wondering what our index number is. So let's take a look at an example here. I'll show you what index numbers are in the Jupyter Notebook. Now, let me declare a variable and give it a string value. Let's say at Eureka. Now, let me check the length of this string. Let's say so it has a length of 7 now. What are index numbers? So index numbers basically start from 0 so at the letter E here index number is going to be 0 and it is going to go until the end of the string. So here at the end is the letter a so index number at the letter A is going to be 6 since we have the length of the string as 7 and the index numbers start from 0 now, let's try to access some values from the string using the index number. So when I write the index number as to I am going to get the value at the index number that is to which is letter you now. We can also perform several operations on strings. For example, we can change the case of the string. We can replace the values in the string. We are going to see if we can actually replace values in the strings or not. So let's try to update a value here at the index number 2 here. So instead of you, let's say I want be here. It is going to show an error which is a type error which says string object does not support item assignment, which means strings are immutable. You cannot change them now to access a series of letters from a string. I can specify a starting index and with the colon here. I can specify the ending index as well. Let's say I write 8 but we only have seven indexes here. Let's see what is going to happen here. So it has actually started from the index to that is you here and has gone to the end of the string. But what if I write ending index as 7 since we have the length of the string as 7. Let's see what it going to do. It is going to show the same thing. But what if I write 6 over there? It is not going to include the last letter because the ending index there is not going to include when we are accessing the values from the string. Now, let's try to do one more thing here. Let's try to make all the letters here to uppercase letters as you can see I've done that similarly. I can make all the letters to lowercase as well. So this was all about string data type. Okay, one more thing. I want to tell you here is to access the values from the end of the string. I can specify the index number using the minus here. So what I'm going to get here is starting from the end of the string. I'm going to get the two letters there that is at the index number 5 that is K. Similarly, if I write name specify the index number 2 here, it is going to give me the same value. So we can also access the values in the string like that also. So this was all about string data type. Now, let's quickly move on to list data type a list is a collection of arrays, which is changeable and ordered which means they have indexes just like strings. So we use the square brackets to declare a list as you can see here. I have the list name fruits and inside the square brackets. I have the list values now. We have to understand that we can declare different data types in the list not just strings or not just integers. We can merge integers and string as well or we can also use other data types in the list as well. So I'm going to show you this in the Jupiter notebook. So let's declare a list first. Give it some integer values first. Some duplicate values as well. Let's just see what happens and a string value as well. As you can see we have successfully declared a list now when I print the list, let's see what all values I will get. So I am getting all the values that have declared here. Now, let me try to access the values using the index number just like we did in the string as you can see we can access the values in the list just like we did in the strings as well using the index number. Now we can also update the values in the list using the index number as well. So let's just try to update the value at index number 2. So instead of 30 I want 35 over there. So let's just see what it does as you can see. We have successfully updated our value in the list. Now, let's try to add a value using append. So what append does is it will add the value at the end of the list. Now, let me show you so there is a value at the end of the list that we have added using the append function. Now, what if I want to add the value at the middle of the list using the index number? So what I'm going to do is I'm going to use the insert function specify the index number and give it a value is just say hundred now when I print the list as you can see at the index number 5. I have added hundred as our value. So the difference between the insert and append is that using the append you can only add the value at the end of the list, but when you're using insert you can add the value specifying the index number now, let me do a few operations here. Let me try to reverse the list here using the reverse function. Now when I print this the list is reverse. So this was all about list here. Let's quickly move on to dictionary now a dictionary is a collection just like a list, but it is unordered changeable and indexed. So we have a key value pair in a dictionary and we can use the keys as indexes because they are unique but the values in the keys can be duplicate as you can see in the example here. I have the dictionary name as animals and in the curly brackets. I have declared the key value pairs. So let's try this in the jupyter notebook as well. So I'll declare a dictionary here. Let's just say courses is my dictionary inside the curly brackets. I will get key values. Let's just say one and give it a value comma key value. That is to and then I'll give another value. Let's just say data science. I can give string values in the key as well. So I'm going to write here machine learning. Now, let's see if we have a successfully declared our dictionary. Yes, we have let's try to print the dictionary now as you can see I am getting all these values with key value pairs. Now I can access the values in the dictionary using the keys as indexes. I'll just write third over here. As you can see I'm getting the value at the key that is third now for the similar purpose. I can use the get function and specify the key value there. It is going to show me the same value now to update a value in the dictionary. I'm just going to write the index number that is our key value here. So instead of machine learning, let's just say Hadoop. All right, so when I print the dictionary now, it is going to show me an updated value. Also, I can add the key value pairs using the square brackets. I'll just specify the key value. Let's just say for here. I'll add machine learning again. Okay, one second. We have made a mistake here. We wrote the wrong name. Now as you can see we have added another value to our dictionary. So this was all about dictionary guys. Let's quickly move on to tuple a tuple is an ordered and unchangeable. Now what it means is it is immutable just like a string. We cannot make any changes in the tuple, but we can have the duplicate values in the tuple as well. So let's try to understand this with an example. So I have a tuple here which has a name animals and I have few values here. So let's just do this in Jupiter notebook as well. So I'll have my tuple as a name animals. So I'll give it a value in round brackets a few integer values first just to check off course and then I'll add some values like Tiger. I'll just say lion and one more I'll give let's say giraffe. Now, let me give a duplicate value here to check if we can actually add a duplicate value or not. I'll say Tiger once again. So I have successfully created a tuple here. Now, let me access the values here using the index number. Let's see if we can do that. So this actually means the tuples are indexed as well. We can use the index values to access the values from the tuple now since it is immutable or we cannot change it. There are not many operations that you can perform on a tuple, but you can count the number of duplicate values using the count function. So you're just going to write the value. Let's say Tiger we have duplicate value over there. So we will check how many times Tiger is there. So it's going to give us the count here. So this was all about tuple guys. So let's quickly move on to set now now a set is a collection just like a list or a dictionary as well, but it is unordered and there are no duplicate entries present. Now, let me show you this with an example in the Jupiter notebook. So I'll give my set as the set name and inside the curly brackets. We can have values. Let's just say 10 20 30 40. I'll also give a few duplicate values just to check if we can have duplicate values or not sing value. Just say a dereka courses as you can see. We have successfully declared a set here. Now, let me try to print this now as you can see there are no duplicate values even though when we have declared the set it was there now, let me try to access the values using the index numbers. It has shown us an error which says set object does not support indexing which means a set does not have any indexes and every time we print a set it is going to show us a random value. So this was all about set guys briefly talk about range now. So range is used whenever we are iterating through values. Suppose we want to print numbers from 0 to 10. Let me put it in a list to get the values. So what I'm going to do is I'll just write 11 over here and it is going to give me the values in the list that is from 0 to 10. So this is all about range guys. Now, let me take a miscellaneous example. Now. I'll have a dictionary with some values again and DJ values. Now, let me try to make a list and try to get the values from A and B as well. Let's see if we can do that. Now when I print see here it is going to show me that our list C has the list a and a dictionary as well. So which shows you can actually make a list with other data types. For example, you can actually incorporate a dictionary over there. You can also do that with the tuple or a set and if you want some value that you don't want to change in the future, you can actually make it a tuple and declare it in the list so that you cannot change that value in the future. For example, if you don't want to access any value using the indexes you can make it with set so that it does not have any indexes. So that is all about data types guys. So there is one more topic that I want to talk about which is type conversion. Now suppose we have an integer here that has 10 value and we have a string as well, which says now when I try to add these two variables name and X it is going to show me a type error which says unsupported operand types now for this error. I am going to do a type conversion here. So let's quickly talk about type conversion before moving on to the example. So type conversion is basically when you convert a type of a variable to another data type. So we have all these functions here which will convert the data type into their respective counterparts. Now, let's try to look at the example now. So we are getting an error here. But what if I change the data type of integer into string? Am I going to get the same error again or not? Let's just see. We're not going to get any errors. So this is what is all about type conversion. Let me show you one more example. So we had a dictionary over there that is with the name be what I'm going to do is I'm going to use the list function and specify be over there. So I have actually converted our dictionary into a list. So this is what is type conversion all about now. We have come to the end of the session guys. If you have any questions, you can mention them in the comment section below and we will be happy to get back to you. Thank you and have a nice day. I hope you have enjoyed listening to this video. Please be kind enough to like it and you can comment any of your doubts and queries and we will reply them at the earliest do look up for more videos in our playlist and subscribe to Edureka channel to learn more. Happy learning.\n",
            "Transcription for Operators In Python  Python Tutorial For Beginners  Python Training  Edureka.mp3 :  Hello guys, this is was seen from Edureka and I welcome you all to this session where I'll be talking about operators in Python. So without wasting any more time, let's look at the agenda for this session. So I'll be starting with what exactly is an operator in Python and why are we using operators in Python moving further? We will discuss various types of operators that we have in Python, for example arithmetic operator assignment operators. Then we have comparison operators Etc. I will also be running a few examples in Jupiter notebook for better understanding. I hope you guys are clear with the agenda. So let's try to understand what exactly is an operator an operator is used to perform operations between two values or variables. Now we can call the operators as constructs or special symbols that are used to manipulate the values of the operands. Now, you must be wondering what is an operand. So the value that we use in an operation are known as operands these operands can be variables or any data type that we have in Python. So let's take an example here. So we have two operands operand one and operand two now when I add an operator between them we can get the result according to the type of operator that we are using here. So before moving on to the types of operator that we have in Python. Let's briefly discuss variables and data types in Python. The purpose of discussing variables and data types is to get an idea of what exactly is variable and data types because while explaining the different types of operators, we are going to use these variables and data types as well. So variables are nothing but the memory locations where we store a value and these values we may or may not change in the future according to the properties they possess. There are six data types in Python namely numbers string list dictionary tuple and a set now, let's take it up to Jupiter notebook to understand these data types briefly talking about numbers or numerical data types. They mainly hold the numerical values. For example a variable. Let's say X is going to hold the value that is 10. So this is going to be a number or a numerical data type now in numerical data types. Also, we have four types of data types. First of all, we have integer which is going to hold the whole numbers. Then we have float data type which is used for declaring decimal point values. And then we have complex numbers which are used to declare imaginary part values. For example, we use the J as imaginary part over here. And then we have a Boolean data type which is used for categorical output that is true or false. So when I print the Boolean number over here, it is going to give me the value as true or false. So this is all about numbers talking about strings. Now strings are used to represent the characters or alphabets we can use the single or double quotes to declare a string in Python. Also strings are immutable in nature, which means you cannot change a string once you have declared and to access a value in a string. You can use the index values over here. So when I use the index number two, it is going to give me the value at the index number two here. So this was all about strings guys talking about list list is a sequence which is ordered and changeable which means you can change values in a list declare a list you have to give a name for your list and we use the square brackets to declare a list in Python list is also index just like a string so we can use the indexes to access the values from a list and we can store different values in a list as well. For example, I can use numbers over here give duplicate values as well and I can use strings over here as well. So when I print my list, it is going to give me the value like this now talking about dictionary dictionary is a sequence just like a list, but we use the key value pair in a dictionary. I'll show you guys to declare a dictionary. We use the curly brackets. Now. I'm going to give the key value pairs over here. So let's say this is my key one. I'll give a semicolon now. I'll give the value over here. I'll give one more key value. Let's say key number two. So when I print my dictionary over here, I'll get the values like this now since it has a key value pair it is not indexed which is why we can use the unique key values as an index to access the values in a dictionary. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to write. The index number as my key value and it is going to fetch me the value at that particular key. So let's talk about set guys a set is also a sequence which is unordered and not indexed which means you cannot access the values using the index number. So I'll just write a few values over here some duplicate values as well. So when I print my set over here, it is going to give me the values like I have mentioned over here and it is not going to hold any duplicate values in a set. Also, we use the curly brackets to declare a set now talking about topple topple is immutable in nature, which means you cannot change a value in a topple once you have declared and we use the round brackets to declare a topple in Python so I can give as many values as I want over here even the duplicate values as well. So when I print my tuple over here, I'm going to get these values that I have declared in the tuple. So the difference between a tuple and a set is not index and it does not contain any duplicate values, but a tuple can contain duplicate values and it is index as well. So we can declare duplicate values in tuples, but not in the set. So this was a brief discussion about variables and data types guys. If you want a detailed discussion about variables and data types, you can check a video on Ed Eureka platform where we have discussed variables and data types in detail where we have also discussed various operations that you can perform on a data type moving on to the different types of operators that we have in Python. So here is a list of all the operators that we have in Python. So first of all, we have arithmetic operators. Then we have assignment operators comparison operators logical operators. Then we have membership operators identity operators and bitwise operators. So we will be discussing all of these operators in detail. So let's talk about arithmetic operators arithmetic operators are nothing but the operators that are used to perform arithmetic operations between variables or two values. So these are the arithmetic operator symbols that we use in Python. So we have addition subtraction multiplication division modulus exponentiation and floor division. So let's take it up to Jupiter notebook to understand the concept of arithmetic operators. So let's say I have two variables X. I'm going to give this value as 10 and then I have one more variable. Let's say why I'll give it a value. Let's say 20 now to understand the concept of arithmetic operators. What I'm going to do is first of all, I will try to perform addition between these two variables. So I'll just write plus over here. And when I execute this I'm going to get the addition as my output now to perform subtraction. I'm going to use the subtraction operator and it is going to give me the value as the subtraction over here. Similarly, I can perform multiplication. Then I can also perform exponentiation. So I'll use two asterisks instead of one for exponentiation. It is that easy in Python guys. Now we will perform division over here. So it is going to give me the value of the division. Now when I do the floor division, I'm going to get the value over here as well. One more operator is left that is the modulus. So I will try to perform modulus as well. So it is going to give me the value that is the remainder. So this was all about arithmetic operators guys. So these are all the symbols that we can use for various purposes like addition subtraction multiplication division Etc. I hope you are clear with the concept of arithmetic operators. Now, let's try to understand the next operator that we have which is assignment operator. So you can imagine what an assignment operator is by the name itself that is assignment. So we use the assignment operators to assign values to a variable or any value that we have in Python, right? So we have assignment operators like is equal to then we have plus is equal to so all these symbols we have let's try to understand what all these are used for for example, let's say we have a variable X which has value 100 now when I write this X plus is equal to 10. It is going to mean the same as X is equal to X plus 10. Similarly, we can write X minus is equal to multiplication is equal to division is equal to or exponentiation is equal to now. Let's try to understand these operators or the assignment operators in Jupiter notebook. So first of all, we have is equal to as our first assignment operator. So I'll have one let's say I have X so I have not assigned any value to this. Let's say what happens. Okay, let's try one more variable. I'll write this so it is showing me a name error which is saying name a is not defined because I have not assigned a value to it. So in Python until you assign a value to a variable, it is not going to be declared in Python. So now when I give the value to this variable, let's say I'll write five over here. It is not showing any error, which means I have assigned a value to this variable. Now, let's try to understand other assignment operators. Let's see. So what does plus is equal to mean in Python. So when I write this what should be the output guys, so let's try to understand this. So when I print a I get the value as 10. So why I'm getting this value because I have assigned the value 5 over here. Then I write one more assignment operator that is plus is equal to 5. So what is going to happen over here is it is going to be same as a is equal to a plus 5. So we have five over here and we have added five more to this statement, which means we are getting the result as 10 over here. Now, let's try to understand other assignment operators as well. So let's say exponentiation is equal to 5. So let's see what the output will be. So when I print this I am getting the exponentiation to the value of 5 since a is equal to 10 and we are doing the exponentiation until five digits. So we are getting the output as hundred thousand. So this was all about assignment operator. Similarly, we can do the division is equal to then we have minus is equal to so these are all the assignment operators that we have in Python. Now, let's talk about the next operator that we have which is comparison operator. So comparison operators are nothing but the operators that we are using to compare two values or objects, right? So we have comparison operators like equal not equal greater than less than greater than or equal to and then we have less than or equal to as well. So let's try to take an example over here. So when I use the equal operator, I am going to write the statement as just I have written over here X is equal to y so when I am using the comparison operator, I'm actually using double equal to so this is the basic difference between assignment operator and comparison operator. So let's take it up to Jupiter notebook to understand these comparison operators guys. So let's say I have two variables value is equal to 10 and number is equal to 20. So to understand the comparison operators, let me take one more variable. I'll say this will be our Boolean variable. So what I'm going to do is I'll write well is equal to number 1 for time checking is or comparing these two values. So what exactly I am doing is comparing these two variables or values that we have that is well and number one. So when I print this compare variable what I'm going to get is either true or false. So it is going to be false because value is not equal to number so I can do the similar thing. I can check whether it is greater than or I can check if it is less than so when I write 10 over here, so I can similarly check if it is greater than or equal to I can check if it is less than or equal to so these are the comparison operators that we have in Python which we can use to compare two values or two objects. Now, let's try to understand the next operator that we have which is the logical operators. So logical operators are used to combine conditional statements. So what are the conditional statements that we have in Python? So let's briefly talk about conditional statement guys. So mainly we have three conditional statements in Python. We have an is if statement then we have an else if statement and we have an else statement. So I'll give you an example for better understanding. So for these two variables only I'll write if well is equal to number one print equal. Else if well is greater than number one print greater else print smaller. So what happened here is guys first of all the execution will go to if statement. It will check this condition if this statement is true. It is going to print this value if this is false. It is going to move to the next statement. That is the else if statement that we have over here. It is going to check this condition if it is true. It is going to print this statement or if this condition is false. It is going to jump to the next statement. That is the else statement and I'll give one more condition. So if all of these conditions are false, it is going to jump to this statement and it is going to print not there over here. If all of these conditions are false, it is going to jump to the next statement that we are going to have in the program, but I have not written any other statements. So it is going to end the execution over here only. So this is a basic example using the conditional statements now that we are done discussing conditional statements. Let's talk about logical operators. So I have told you logical operators are used to combine conditional statements. So what exactly are the logical operators? So we have a logical and we have logical or or we have a logical not as well by looking at the example. Let's say we have two conditions over here. We have X is greater than 5 and then we have X is greater than 10. So let's try to understand these logical operators in Jupiter notebook. Now, let's say I have two statements. All right X is equal to 10 and what I'm going to do is I'm going to check if X is greater than 10. All right, and which is my logical and operator and I'll write X is greater than 5. So what is going to happen if I use the logical and operator if both of these statements are true. It is going to give the result as true. But if one of these statements is false, it is going to give me the value or the output as false. So, let's see what happens if I execute this statement. I'm getting false because one of these statements is false. Now when I write instead of 10 if I write eight over here, let's see what happens since both of these statements are true. It is going to give me the output as true now instead of and operator if I use the logical or operator, let's see what is going to happen. It is showing me that it is true because when we are using the logical or operator only one of these statements has to be true the output will be true. But what happens if both of these statements are false? It is showing me the value that is false. But let's see what happens if both of these statements are true. I'm getting true as well. So one of the statements has to be true when we are using the or operator now talking about logical not operator. What I'm going to do is I'll write not in the beginning now. I'll specify the condition. Let's say X is greater than 10 and X is greater than 5. This is the same statement that we have used before and for this we have got the output as false. So let's see when we use the logical not operator. What is going to be the output? I'm getting true as the output here because this statement is negated over here using the not operator and we are getting the opposite value that we should be getting for this statement. So this is the purpose which fulfills by using the not operator or the logical not operator that we have in Python. So now that we are done with logical operators as well. Let's try to understand what our identity operators. So identity operators are used to compare objects. Now, you must be wondering what are objects here. So everything in Python is actually an object so we can use the data types as objects as well. So let's try to understand what are the identity operators in Python. So we have is and we have is not so these are the identity operators. So what is does is it returns true if both the variables are same object. For example, let's try to do this in Jupiter notebook. So what I'll do is I'll take let's say a list. I'll give it of some values. Let's say 10 20 and 30. I'll take one more list give it the same values. Let's say 10 20 and 30. And I'll write X is equal to list one. So when I use the identity operators, let's say if I write X is list one, let's see what is output that I'm going to get I'm getting true because X is actually the same object as list one. Now, let's try to write list one is list two, even though when we have used the same values in list one and list two, let's see what the output will be it is false because these are the not the same objects, right? Similarly, I can use list one is not list two. So here I am going to get the output as true because list one is not exactly list to even though we have the same values. It is not going to be the same object. So this is the concept about the identity operators. Now, let's talk about the next one that we have is membership operators in Python. So membership operators are used to check if a sequence is present in an object or not now to understand the difference between an identity and a membership operator. Okay, let's first understand what are the operators in membership operator we have in and then we have not in so it is going to return true if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object and it will return true if the sequence is not present. So let's do this in Jupiter notebook. We have already specified these objects. So let's try to do if X in list one. Let's see what happens. It is going to show me that it is false because we have no values in X. So when I do the same thing with list one in list two now, you see we have the same values over here. Let's see what the output will be it is false again. Okay, let me do one thing now to check a particular value or a particular sequence. What I'm going to write is I'll check if 10 in list one. So it is going to check if this is going to be present over here or not. It is showing me that it is true. So what if I write like this 10 20 30 in list 2 it is false. So this is the basic difference between is that is then identity operator and membership operators. So when I write let's say. It is going to check if this is present in the sequence or not. It is showing false because it is not there. But what if I add this value over here, let's say now when I execute the same statement, I am getting true because this sequence is actually present in the object now to understand the difference between is equal to and the identity operator. Let's see what is going to happen. What if I write list 1 is equal to list 2 it is showing false. I have made a change over here. So I'll do this once again. So when I print this it is showing that it is true, but instead of is equal to if I write is over here. It is going to show me false because these are two different objects. So this is the basic concept of identity and membership operators guys. Now, let's understand bitwise operators. So bitwise operators are used to compare binary values or binary numbers. So this is a rather difficult concept guys. So I'll be telling you about what are binary numbers first and then we'll be moving on to the bitwise operators that we have in Python. So these are the bitwise operators like bitwise and bitwise or so these are the symbols used for these operators guys. So this is actually what happens when we are using these operators. So let's try to understand bitwise and operator first in Jupiter notebook. So what I'm going to do is I'll just write 10 and 12. So what is going to happen over here? Let's say it is showing me the output as 8 but it is not clear why we are getting this output, right? So let's understand what 10 is in binary numbers. So when I write 10 in binary numbers, it is going to be 1 0 1 0 and similarly for 12. It is going to be 1 1 0 0 now when I use the logical and operator what is going to do is if both the bits are 1 it is going to be 1 so in this case only first bit is 1 over here. So the output will be 1 0 0 0 and if we convert this to decimal it is going to be the number 8. So this is the concept between the binary numbers guys. Similarly, I can use 10 or 12. So what is happening here is I have these values. Let's say 1 0 1 0 4 10 and 1 1 0 0 4 12 now looking at first bits here that is 0 0 it is going to be 1 so all of these bits in the output will be 1 1 1 1 which is exactly is equal to 14. So this is the concept of using the bitwise operators where we are using the values as binary numbers. We are comparing the binary numbers. Now, let's talk about left shift and right shift guys. So this is what I write for doing the right shift. So 10 in binary numbers is 1 0 1 0. So when I write shift these two bits, I'm going to be left with 1 0 and when I convert this to binary, I'm going to get the value as 2 so this is the concept of right shift guys. Now, let's try to understand left shift. So when I write this I'm going to get the value as 40. Now, let's try to understand how I am getting this value. So 10 if I write it in binary is going to be 1 0 1 0. So when I do the left shift, what is going to happen is it is going to shift two values and I'm going to get the value as 1 0 1 0 0 0. So what is happening here? If I convert this binary number to decimal, I'm going to get the value as 40. So this is why I'm getting the value 40 over here. So this is the concept of bitwise operators guys. I hope you are clear with the concept of bitwise operators. It is a bit complicated because we are using the binary numbers. Even though I'm telling you these binary numbers. You need not mention them while using the operators. For example for these bitwise operators all these are written over here. Let's say if you are using the bitwise and operator it will set each bit to one if both bits are one as I've shown you and then before bitwise or operator. It is going to be one if one of the bits is one. So similarly for XOR it will set each bit to one if only one of the bits is one and then we have bitwise not operator which is going to invert all bits. Let's say if we have all bits that is one it is going to convert all those bits to 0 and then I have told you about left shift and right shift as well. So this is about operators in Python guys now that we have come to the end of the session if you have any questions, you can put them in the comment section and our team will get back to you as soon as possible.

            "Transcription for Python Comments  How To Write Comments In Python  Python Tutorial For Beginners  Edureka.mp3 :  Have you ever asked any programmer to explain the code he wrote a year ago or have you ever tried reading your own previously written code? It would become a very time-consuming and tiring task guys if you had to reanalyze every block of code from scratch. Well, the best thing to do is add a comment. Hey guys, welcome back to a new session from Edureka. My name is Vaji ha and today's topic is comments in Python. So let's just quickly move ahead and look at Watson store under this topic. Firstly, we shall understand what exactly comments mean and when to use them then I'll be showing you all how to write comments in Python and how they're going to be interpreted following that we will be looking at the types of comments that is single line and multi-line comments and a few shortcuts related to them. And finally, we will be looking at docstring comments or to be more precise docstrings as comments. So I hope you're clear with this moving on towards the first topic of the session. What are comments? No, they are not something there just to increase the size of your code. But guys they are indeed very meaningful comments are programmer coherent statements that describe what a block of code means and they get very useful especially when you're writing large blocks of code say for example, you've developed some software previously and now you're working on something that's new and completely different at this point of time. You find that your previous software is throwing some error. You would have completely forgotten what you did and how so this is where comments come into picture a good code actually consists of relevant comments. These comments actually increase the readability of the program not just to the programmer but to the others as well. Now that you know, what are comments let's move on and see when to use them. The best practice is to write comments as and how you proceed with your code comments are very useful, but only if they are implemented wisely. Just keep the following points in mind when you're commenting your code make sure your comments are very precise and clear and preferably shot as well. They need to be as specific as possible to the block of code. They are included with please make sure you use the recent language guys and do not repeat your comments as they become redundant. Now that you know, what are comments and their importance. Let's see how to write them in Python comments in Python are preceded by a hash character as you can see on the screen over here. I have a small example with some two lines of code. My first line is a comment and my second line is a print statement. Now, let's move on towards a Jupyter Notebook and see how this works. Now, let's move on towards a Jupyter Notebook and write some comments all I'm going to do over here is I'll open a new Python notebook and I will rename this notebook to rename your notebook guys. All you have to do is click on the title give whatever title you want. And use rename. Like I've told you before come and start with a hash character in Python. So here I'm going to write a comment preceded by a hash. As you can see my output. There is nothing related to the comment line and whatever I have printed in the print statement has been returned as my output. Now, this is how comments work. They do not show up in your output. Now, let's get back to our presentation and see how they are interpreted which is exactly what is our next topic whenever the interpreter encounters a hash symbol. It omits whatever is present after that the hash character actually tells the interpreter to stop reading whatever is present after that until the end of that line. So when you're writing comments, whatever is present after your hash character is going to be omitted by your interpreter. Now, what if the hash character was present inside the string? Let's go to our Jupiter notebook and see what happens. I'm including a hash character within a string and I will run this. As you can see when I run this the string is returned which means a hash inside a string means a hash itself and nothing else. So you cannot write comments within a string. Okay. So I hope you've understood how to write comments now, let us move ahead and see what are the types of comments comments can either be single line or multi-line single line comments can either appear individually or in line with some other code multi-line comments have to be preceded by a hash character in every line they appear now. Let's see a small example of single line comments. Like I've told you before single line comments can appear either in an individual line or in line with some other code. Now, let's move on towards a Jupiter notebook and write some single line comments. I'll just create a heading over here to create a heading. All you have to do is go to code select heading. Give whatever heading you want as your heading and prefix it by a hash a single hash tells that it's H1 level heading two hashes tell that it's H2 and so on. You can use the heading level of your choice here. I prefixed my heading by a single hash, which means it's of level H1. Now, let's write some single line comments. As you can see over here. My first line of code is a comment line. I've prefixed this line by a hash character and in my last line, I have an inline comment this inline comment is present with some part of the code as you can see in the output. None of the comments have been returned. Now, let's get back to our presentation and see how multi-line comments work. Like I've already told you multi-line comments can appear anywhere in your code, but each line needs to be prefixed by a hash character. For example, as you can see on your screens, I have a hash character present in the first two lines of my code after that. I have some code followed by it. You can see in the output that none of these lines have been returned. Now, let's go to our Jupiter notebook and write some multi-line comments. As you can see over here, I have three initial comment lines and all three have been prefixed by a hash after that I have some code and you can see in the output that none of the comment lines have been returned and whatever code is present after that and output is returned based on this code now typing a hash everywhere might be a problem and many of us would not like to do so. Let's look at some shortcut methods of how to comment multiple lines at once. All you have to do is type your multi-line comments first. Hold the control key and left click wherever you want to insert a hash character just like how I'm showing you and then type it once and it appears wherever I have inserted the cursor as you can see on the screens now in case you want to remove multiple hash characters all at once do the same thing hold the control key click on wherever you want to remove the hash character from and press the backspace key as you can see from two lines. I removed a hash character in a single go. So these are some shortcut methods to comment multiple lines. Many of us think that comments and doc strings are same. Now, let's move ahead and see what are doc strings and whether they are actually comments or not doc strings are not actually comments, but they are documentation strings these strings are written within triple quotes. They are not assigned to any variable and many a times they are used as comments as well. Now you'd be thinking what is the difference between doc strings and comments doc strings are not omitted by the interpreter unlike comments comments are omitted by your interpreter and nothing present after the hash character is going to be read by it on the other hand doc strings are strings that describe something about the code doc strings actually tell what some function is going to do whereas the comments will tell how it is going to do. So this is the difference between doc strings and comments now, let's go to a Jupyter notebook and see their functionality. Like I've told you before doc strings are written within triple quotes as you can see in the output when I execute this it returns the string itself. Whereas in case of a comment when I execute a comment it does not return anything which means the interpreter does not omit doc strings whereas it omits the comment now these doc strings are efficiently used when you want to describe something about a class or a function or something else now these doc strings can either appear in your output or they can be omitted based on where you're going to place them. Let's try to place a doc string initially before the code starts. As you can see in my output the doc string has not been returned whereas when I use the doc string individually without any code and I executed it you could see that it had returned the string itself. But when I include the doc string before the code and after that I've included some code lines and I run this you can see that only the output for my code is present and nothing related to the doc string has been returned to my output now, let's try to include a doc string after some code. As you can see over here when I included the doc string after the code it has returned the output for the code as well as the string itself. So when you're making use of doc strings, just be specific of whether you wanted to be returned in your output or not many a times these strings are called rather than writing it again and again. So I hope you've understood what are comments and doc strings as well. Okay. So this was a last topic of this session. So I hope you've enjoyed and learned something new in this session. Please make sure to practice as much as possible guys because that is how you learn and if you have any suggestions or queries, please do let me know in the comment section and I will revert to you at the earliest take care and goodbye. I hope you have enjoyed listening to this video. Please be kind enough to like it and you can comment any of your doubts and queries and we will reply them at the earliest do look up for more videos in our playlist and subscribe to Edureka channel to learn more.

            "Transcription for Arrays In Python  Python Array Operations  Python Tutorial For Beginners  Edureka.mp3 :  Hey everyone. Welcome to Edureka's YouTube channel. My name is Vaji ha and today I'll be taking a session on arrays in Python. So I hope everyone's ready to head start this session. So let's move on in this session today guys. I'll be covering the following topics. First of all, I'll be explaining what exactly is an array and then I'll be differentiating between Python lists and arrays. Now, this is a very common question that many of us ask after that. I'll be showing you all how to create arrays in Python following which we will try to access array elements and then we will try to perform some basic operations on arrays such as finding the length of an array adding and removing elements from it array concatenation slicing and looping through an array. So I hope everyone's clear with this agenda. Anil says yes. Preeti Ayushi and Rahul give me a thumbs up. Shashank says he's ready. Okay. I presume all the others are ready as well. Now, let's move on towards the first topic. Our first topic for this session is what exactly is an array and array is basically a data structure guys with ordered series of elements any variable that is declared as an array can hold more than one value at the same time all values in an array have a particular address which is specified by its index number here as you can see on the screen. I've declared a variable a as an array and I've stored values from 1 to 100 in my array, which is a also make a note of the index values indexing always starts from 0 and not from 1 therefore a of 0 holds 1 a of 1 holds 2 a of 2 holds 3 and similarly a of 99 holds 100 when the length of my array is n the index value will be n minus 1 it is always one less than the length of the array. So I hope you're clear with this topic. Anil has a question. He asks what does ordered series of elements mean and in ordered series of elements means that every element is present at its particular address and this address is specified by its index value. So in case I have two elements that are same for example, if a of 1 has to and a of 2 also has to both these elements are unique pertaining to their index value and they are ordered by the index values or addresses. So I hope I've cleared your doubt tunnel. Just give me a confirmation. Okay, Anil says yes. Now, let's move on towards our next topic for this session, which is the difference between Python lists and arrays Python lists and arrays have the same way of storing data, but there is a key difference that you all have to note arrays can store only single data type values whereas lists can store any data type values. So for example, if I have an array of integer values all values present in that array will be integers and nothing else on the other hand if I have a list then it can store integers together with float and cars and strings Etc. Now when you try to perform some operations like slicing or looping it will be similar for both. But when you try to perform different operations, like if you want to multiply your array values by two or you want to divide it by two you can do so easily when you have an array, but if you try to do the same with the list, it will throw an error because naturally you cannot multiply cars and Springs or divide them. So I hope you're clear with the difference between these two. So now let's move on towards the next topic how to create arrays in Python unlike other programming languages. If you want to create arrays in Python, you will have to import the array module. Now this module has all the functions that are necessary for creating and performing various kinds of operations on arrays to import the array module. You can use three ways first is to import the array module by its original name, which is array the second method is to use an alias name. This is the most widely and commonly used method as well in my demonstrations. I'm going to be using this method. The third way is using star from array import star. What this does is it's going to import all that is present in your array module. Now, let's go to our Jupiter notebook and try to do this. Please do it along with me guys. I'll open a new notebook. And I will use the first method to import the array module. As you can see when I hit run no error has been returned which means this is executed. Now, let's try to create arrays using this method. As you can see over here, I've created an array a using the first method. So I have used array dot array of integer values and I've specified some random integer values here. The first array is the name of the module. The second array is the array constructor and then I've given a type code this type code specifies what type of elements my array will hold as you can see I've created an array. So I hope you're clear with how to create arrays using the first method. Now, let me open a new notebook and try the second method. The reason to open a new notebook is because I've already imported array module in this notebook. I'll rename this notebook because I'm going to be using this method in further demonstrations as well. As you can see over here when I use import array as a RR a RR here is my alias name when I use this and hit run it does not throw any error. Now, let me try to create arrays using this method. I'm using int as my data type. You can use any data type of your choice. As you can see that an array has been created with some random integer values in place of the module name array. I've used a RR now, let's try the third method. I'll open a new notebook again. As you can see over here when I'm creating arrays using the third method. I've just specified the constructor name and then the type code and the value list. So I hope you are clear with how to create arrays using all three methods. Okay. So now let's get back to our presentation. Our next topic for this session is accessing array elements to access array elements. You'll have to make use of the index values each index value holds a unique element. Like I've told you before indexing starts from 0 and not from 1 so therefore a of 0 holds 1 a of 1 holds 2 and so on. This is the normal traversal order which starts from the left-hand side and moves towards the right-hand side. But here I want you all to note this point as well that negative indexing also exists. So negative indexing will start from the right-hand side and move towards the left-hand side. Therefore hundred will be at a of minus 1 99 will be at a of minus 2 and similarly one will be at a of minus 100. So I hope you are clear with negative indexing. Now, let's go to our Jupiter notebook and try to access some array elements. As you can see over here, I've created a heading to create a heading. All you have to do is go to code select heading and prefix your text with the number of hashes based on the heading level you want. So if I want H1, I will use one hash if I want H2, I will use to and so on here. I've created a heading of H1. So I prefixed my text with one hash now. Let me try to access some array elements. As you can see over here when I access a of 2 my output is 3. Let's see where 3 is present in my array 1 is present at a of 0 2 at a of 1 and 3 at a of 2. So therefore when I access a of 2 3 has been returned. Are you guys clear with this? Just give me a quick confirmation before I move on towards the next topic. Shashank says yes. Preeti says please try to access something using negative index values. Okay, Preeti. Let me show you that as well. So here I've tried to access a of minus 2 a of minus 2 has returned 5. Let's get back to our array a and see where 5 is present 6 is at a of minus 1 and 5 is at a of minus 2 therefore my output is 5. So Preeti are you clear with this? Okay, Preeti says yes. Now, let's move on towards our presentation and see what is the next topic. Our next topic of this session is basic array operations here. I just want to tell you all something arrays are mutable, which means they are changeable. So in case you want to add or remove elements from it, you can do so easily now coming back to our presentation our first operation under this section will be finding the length of an array. The second is adding or changing elements of an array and then we will try to remove or delete elements of an array and then guys we will try to perform array concatenation slicing and finally we will be looping through an array. Now, let's move on towards the first operation to find the length of an array. You will have to make use of the length function. Now this function returns an integer value, which is equal to the number of elements that are actually present in your array. The length function takes one parameter, which is the name of your array as you can see in the example of here. I've created some random array a and I've given some random values as you can see. I have three values over here and when I use the length function and I specify the name of my array the output is 3 which is equal to the number of elements that are present in my array. Now, let's move towards a jupyter notebook and see how this works. As you can see over here when I use the length function and I've given the array name, which is a an integer value is returned, which is 6 6 is the number of elements that are actually present in my array, which is a okay. So I hope you're clear with this. So our next operation is adding elements to an array in case you want to add elements to an array. You can do so using the append extend or the insert function. You can do so using the append extend or the insert function the append function is used when you want to add an element to the end of your array. The extent function is used when you want to add more than one elements to the end of your array the insert function specifically adds a new element to a particular position in the original array. Let's have a look at a small example of these three as you can see on the screen. I've created some random array a and then I've used the append function and I've given the value that I want to add to my array as you can see in the output 3.4, which is the value I've specified to the append function has been added to the end of my array, which is a and then I've used the extend function. Please make a note over here that when you use the extend function, you will have to specify the values between square brackets. If you don't use the square brackets, it will throw an error. I've given three new values and all three values have been added to the end of my array and then I've tried to use the insert function over here. I've specified the index number as to and the value to be inserted at that position as 3.4 as you can see in the output 3.4 has been inserted at C of 2. Now, let's go to our Jupiter notebook and we'll do the same. I'll reprint my array, which is a so that it's easy for us to refer to it. Since my array a holds integer values. I will give some new integer value to it. As you can see, I've given eight as the value that I want to insert in my array and eight has been added to the end of my array. Now, let me try to give some float value to this array and see what happens. As you can see when I try to append some float value, it gives me a type error. Therefore I can add only those values which is specific to the type of elements that are present in that array. Now, let me try to use the extend function. Like I've told you all when you're using the extend function, you will have to make use of the square brackets. As you can see in the output all the values that I've specified within the extend function have been added to the end of my array. Now, let me use the insert function. I've used the insert function and the first parameter of specified is the index value and the second is the element to be inserted at this index position. So at index value a of 2 6 will be inserted as you can see in the output 6 has been inserted at a of 2. So I hope you're clear with how to add elements to an array. Now, let's move on towards the next operation. Our next operation is removing elements of an array in case you want to remove elements from an array. You can make use of the pop or the remove function. The pop function removes the element and returns it whereas the remove function will remove it but it will not return it. The pop function can either take no parameters or one parameter the parameter it takes is the index value of the element to be removed if you do not specify any parameter. It will remove the last element from the array the remove function takes one parameter which is the element to be removed itself. Now, let's have a look at a small example of this as you can see on the screen. I've created some random array a and then I've used the pop function without specifying any parameter as you can see in the output when I do not specify any parameter the last value present in my array has been popped and returned as well. Second time I've used the pop function and I've given some index value. Now this pop function will remove the element that is present at this index position as you can see it has removed 3.1 and returned it as well. After that, I've used the remove function like I've told you before the remove function takes one parameter which is the element to be removed and you can see in the output that the remove function has not returned any value after that I've printed my array and you can see all the values that are removed using these two functions are no more present in the array a now let's go to our Jupyter notebook and do the same. Let me reprint my array, which is a first I will use the pop function without specifying any parameter to it. As you can see over here when I do not give any parameter it removes the last element that is present in my array now, let me give some index value to it. I'll reprint my array a because I've removed an element from it. Now, let me give some index value to the pop function. As you can see when I use a dot pop of two, it removes the element which is presented a of two, which is six and it returns it as well. Let me try to use some negative index value for the pop function. A dot pop of minus 1 removes the last element that is present in my array, which is 5 now I'll use the remove function. Let me reprint my array guys as you can see all the elements that have been removed using the pop function are no more present in my array a. Like I've told you before when using the remove function, you will have to specify the element that is to be removed here. Let me remove it because there are two occurrences of it and let's see what the remove function does when I hit run remove function does not return anything. Now, let me print my array a and see what is present as you can see the first occurrence of it has been removed, but the remove function did not return the value. So I hope you're clear with the remove and the pop functions now, let's get back to our presentation and perform the next operation our next operation is array concatenation concatenation means joining. So in case you want to join different arrays, you can make use of the plus symbol as you can see on the screen. I've created some random array a and B and then I've created some random array C, which is empty also make a note that all three arrays have the same type code and then I've concatenated a and B into my empty array, which is C as you can see in the output all the elements present in a and B have been concatenated into my array C. Now, let's go to our Jupyter notebook and perform array concatenation. I'm using int as my data type. You can use any data type of your choice. To create an empty array. All you have to do is specify the type code and leave the value list empty here. I've created an empty array D and I've concatenated B and C into my array, which is D now, let me hit run when I hit run all elements present in B and C have been concatenated into my new array, which is D. So I hope you are clear with array concatenations. Let me just show you what happens if I try to concatenate arrays of different data types. I'll just change one of my previously created arrays type code and I'll give it as float. Let's see what happens when I change the type code and I try to concatenate these two arrays. You can see that I've encountered an error and it says type error, which means it cannot concatenate two arrays of different data types. So just be careful when you're concatenating arrays. You cannot concatenate arrays which hold different data type elements. Okay. Now, let's move on towards our presentation and see what is the next operation. Our next operation is slicing and array slicing actually means fetching some particular values from your array to do. So you can make use of the colon symbol as you can see on the screen. I've created some random array a and I've sliced it from 0 to 3 0 specifies from where fetching has to start and three specifies where it has to stop. So it will start from 0 it will go until 3 but it will not include the value which is present at 3 as you can see in the output. I have a of 0 a of 1 and a of 2 that is present in my output. Now, let's go to our Jupyter notebook and we will try to slice our arrays. I'll reprint my array D over here and then I will try to slice it. As you can see I've sliced my array from 0 to 5 so it will start from index number 0 it will go to 5 but it will not include the value which is present at index number 5. You can also see the same in the output over here. Let me try to use some negative index value. My output when I use 0 colon minus 2 contains all the values between 0 and minus 2 but it will not include the value which is present at minus 2. Okay. So I hope you're clear with this topic. Just give me a quick confirmation before I move on. Okay, Anil says yes. Shashank has a question. He asks what does colon colon minus 1 mean Shashank unlike what many of us think colon colon minus 1 does not reverse my array, but it prints a reversed copy of my array. So let's try to do this over here. As you can see all the elements present in array D have been reversed. Now, let's print our array, which is D the original array D is the same but colon colon minus 1 has reprinted a reversed copy of my array, which is D this method is actually not preferred because it exhausts the memory. So I hope I've cleared your doubt Shashank. Just give me a quick confirmation. Okay, Shashank says yes. Now, let's get back to our presentation and perform the last operation of this session, which is looping through an array. You all might be familiar with these two loops, which is the for and the while loops the for loop iterates over the items of an array specified number of times whereas the while loop iterates until some condition is met or some condition is true when you're using the while loop. You will have to keep three things in mind. One is initializing your iterator. Second is to specify a condition. Third is to increment your iterator. Remember that if you do not increment your iterator, your while loop will go on forever. Let's see a small example of this as you can see on the screen. I've created some random array a and then I've used the for loop to loop through my array. I've used for X in a print X which means go to every element that is present in a and print it. Let's try to do the same on our Jupiter notebook. Let me reprint my array D. Now, let me use the for loop to loop through this array. For X in a print X, which means go to every element in D and print it as you can see all elements present in D have been returned one after the other. Now, let me try to slice this array and print specific elements. As you can see over here, I've sliced my array from index number 0 to minus 3 and I've printed only those specific values using the for loop now, let's go to our presentation and have a look at the while loop like I've told you before when you're using the while loop you will have to do three things. One is initializing your iterator. Second is to specify the condition and third is to increment your iterator. Let's try to perform looping on our Jupiter notebooks. Please do it along with me guys. Let me reprint my array D. Here. I'm using the iterator as temp. You can use any name of your choice. As you can see over here, I've initialized my iterator to 0 and then I've specified a condition wherein I have told whenever the value of my temporary variable is less than D of 2 then print that value and then I have iterated the value of temp. I can also use temp plus equal to 1 which is same as temp equal to temp plus 1 now, let's try to use the while loop using the len function here. I will use my array a so let me reprint it over here. As you can see over here when I use the len function my temporary variable will go to all elements present in my array a and print them one after the other. So I hope you're clear with looping. Okay.

            "Transcription for Sets In Python  Python Sets Tutorial  Python Tutorial for Beginners  Edureka.mp3 :  Data in today's world is the backbone of every sector. This data is organized into data structures which form the storehouse of data. Hey guys, Edureka brings to you a new session on the study of one of these data structures, which is python sets. My name is Vajiha and before I start with the session, let's have a quick look at all that is bundled here for you all to begin with. Let's understand what exactly is a set and when to use this data structure following that I'm going to show you all how to create sets in Python and then we'll perform some operations on sets such as accessing set elements finding the length of a set adding and removing elements from it and then some mathematical operations which are Union intersection and difference of sets. Finally, we will be looking at what a frozen sets and how to create them in Python. So I hope everyone's clear with this. So moving on towards the first topic of this session, which is what is a set a set is basically a data structure guys, which is a collection of unordered elements all elements in a set are unique, which means every element is present just once now these values can be of any data type, but they are not indexed and because of this you cannot perform indexing operations such as slicing on sets. So now that you know, what are sets let's move on and see when to use sets in Python sets can be used when the order of data actually does not matter. But the only concern is your data elements need to be unique. So now let's move on to see how to create sets in Python to create sets in Python. You can use two methods. The first method is to use the curly braces and the second is to use the set constructor. I have a small example where I've created a set a using curly braces and a set B using the set constructor. Now, let's move on towards our Jupiter notebook and create some sets in Python. The first thing I'm going to do over here is change the name of my notebook. You can give any name of your choice and rename it like I've already told you you can create sets in two ways. The first to use curly braces and the second to use the set constructor. Let's just create some sets using both these methods. I've created a set a using curly braces and then I've specified some random values to it. You can also notice that all these values are of different data types. After that, I've created a set B using the set constructor. This set constructor has converted a list of values into a set hope you're clear with how to create sets. Now, let me just show you all how to create an empty set using the set constructor. All you have to do is give some name to your set. Say for example see and use the set constructor without passing any values to it and hit run now when you print this set you can see that the set is empty. It has returned an output which is an empty set. So I hope you're clear with how to create sets in Python. Now, let me just show you all what are all the methods you can use along with sets to do. So you can use the dir method and supply the name of the set as a parameter to it when I used dir and past a as a parameter, which is a set that I've already created. It has returned a number of methods as its output. So all these are the methods you can use along with sets. Now, let's get back to our presentation and see what are the operations we are going to perform in this session today. First of all, we'll be finding the length of a set and accessing its elements after that we will be adding or updating elements of a set and then removing and deleting elements from it following that we'll perform the mathematical operations in our Union intersection and difference of sets. Now, let's move on towards the first operation of this session, which is finding the length of a set to find the length of a set you can use the len method. The length of a set is the number of elements that are actually present in that set and this len function will return an integer value which is equal to the number of elements present in the set. I have a small example where I've created some random set with the name my set and I've passed some values to it after that I've used the len function and pass the name of the set as a parameter. Now, let's go to our Jupiter notebook and see what happens when I do this. I've already created set a B and C. I'll just reprint my set a over here so that it's easy for us to refer to it. Now, let's find the length of a. When I used Len of a it has returned 7 as the output which is equal to the number of elements present in my set a now let's get back to our presentation and see how to access elements of a set since set contain unordered elements. You cannot use index values to access its elements, but you can loop through it to access the elements of a set. I'll just jump on to my Jupiter notebook and show you all how to access set elements. I'll reprint my sets a and B over here. I've used the for loop to access the elements of set a all. I have done is for every element present in a print that element and as you can see in the output all the elements present in a have been returned one after the other now, let's get back to our presentation and see how to add elements to a set to add elements to a set. You can use either the add method or the update method. Now this add method will allow you to add a single element to your set, but the update method will allow you to add a list of values to your set. I'm going to be showing you all how to use both these methods in this session. So here is my Jupiter notebook when I use the update method. I've passed a list of values to be added to the set C but here I've passed three again and three has been added just once and it's not been repeated again. This is because sets contain unique elements and there is no second copy of one element present in a set. So I hope you've understood how to add elements to a set. Now, let's move on to understand how you can remove elements from a set to remove elements from a set you can make use of the remove discard or the pop methods the remove method takes one parameter, which is the element to be removed from your set now in case that element is not present in the set this method is going to throw an error. The question is what if you're not sure if some element is present in your set or not, but you want to make sure that this element is not present and your program does not throw an error in this case. You can use the discard method the discard method takes one parameter, which is the element to be removed and in case that element is not present in the set this method will not throw any error now moving on towards the pop Function the pop method removes a random element from your set. Now, let's get back to our Jupiter notebook and use these methods. I'll reprint all the three sets over here. First I will use the remove method. I've used the remove method and I've specified 2.4 to be removed from the set a when I print the set a 2.4 is no more present in my set. Now, let me try to pass some value that is not present in the set a. When I use a dot remove six, which is not present in the set a it has thrown and key error and it's specified that six is the key which is not present in the set a so I hope you've understood how to use the remove method. Now, let's use the discard method and see what happens. When I used B dot discard three, it has removed three from the set B. Now, let's try to give some parameter to the discard method which is not present in set B. When I used B dot discard 90 it has executed but it has not thrown any error. So I hope you're clear with both these methods. Now, let's try to use the pop method when I used a dot pop it has popped some random value from the set a and it has returned it as the output of here one is no more present in the set a so I hope you're clear with how to add and remove elements from a set. Now, let's move on to our presentation and see how you can find the union of sets union of sets refers to the concatenation of two or more sets into a single set. But in case you have any common values in these set the resulting set will contain just one copy of the common element. You can perform the Union operation in two ways. One is using the pipeline symbol and the second is using the Union method. I have a small example where I've created a set a and B and then I've used the pipeline symbol and the Union method to find the Union of these two sets. Let's go to a Jupyter notebook and see how this works. I'll reprint my sets ABC over here. I've used the pipeline symbol to find the Union of a and B all the elements that are present in a and B has been returned as a new set, which is the Union of a and B, but the common element are just printed once now, let's see how to use the Union method to perform this operation. I've used the Union method to find the Union of a and B. Now, let's try to find the Union of three sets using both these methods. As you can see in the output, I've used the pipeline symbol to find the Union of three sets and then I've used the Union method to find the Union of a B and C. So I hope you're clear with this now. Let's get back and see what is intersection of sets the intersection of two or more sets is the formation of a new set consisting only of the common elements that are present in all these sets. You can perform this operation in two ways. One is using the ampersand symbol and the second is to use the intersection function. I'll be showing you all how exactly to do this on our Jupyter notebook. I've used the ampersand symbol to find the Union of a and B and you can see over here the elements that are common between the set a and B are for an ABC. Hence the output now, let's try to use the intersection function. I've determined the intersection of a B and C using the intersection function and the resultant is a string which is present in all these sets. So I hope you're clear with both these methods. Now, let's get back to our presentation and see what is the difference of sets the difference of sets produces a new set which contains all the elements that are present in one set except the common elements to make you all understand this concept clearly. Let me jump on to my Jupyter notebook to find the difference of set. You can use either the minus symbol or the difference method first over here. I'll be using the minus symbol. When I found the difference of a minus B, I've got all the elements that are present in a but not the common elements of a and B when I used B minus a a set has been returned which contains all the elements of B except the common elements of B and a so I hope you're clear with what is the difference of sets now, let's use the difference method to do the same. I've used the difference method to find a minus C and as you can see all the elements present in a but not the common elements of a and C have been returned as my output. You can use the difference method to find the difference of three sets as well. When I found the difference of a minus B minus C using the difference method only one element has been returned which is present in a and not present in B and C. Hope you're clear with this now. Let's move on towards our final topic of this session, which is the concept of a frozen set a frozen set is a set whose values cannot be modified, which means when you freeze a set it becomes immutable to create frozen sets in Python. You can use the frozen set method as you all know, I've created a set a just make a note guys that you cannot add or remove values from a frozen set as you all know, I've created a set a which is a normal set and I've been using it to add and remove values from it. Now, let's freeze this set. I've created a new set D, which is a frozen set and I've supplied the values of a as a parameter to this frozen set Constructor. Now, let's see what happens if I try to add some values to this frozen set. When I used D dot add 3 it has returned an attribute error, which says frozen set object has no attribute at therefore, frozen sets are immutable and you cannot change the values present in the frozen set frozen set helps to serve as a key in the dictionary. So I hope you're clear with all that's been covered in this session today. So guys, this was our last topic of this session. I hope you've enjoyed and learn something new.

            "Transcription for Dictionary In Python  Python Dictionary Tutorial  Python Certification Training  Edureka.mp3 :  Hello guys, this is Vasim from Edureka and I welcome you all to this session where I'll be talking about dictionary in Python as you guys all know Python programming language is one of the most popular programming language nowadays. It provides us with numerous applications and various out-of-the-box features. One such concept is the dictionary in Python in this session. We will learn about Python dictionary in detail before moving on. Let's take a look at the agenda for this session. First of all, I'll be starting with what exactly is a dictionary in Python and why do we use a dictionary? Then we will compare the dictionary with the list moving further. We will learn how to implement a dictionary and various operations that we have for dictionary in Python. And finally, I will sum up this session with a small use case to explain the concept of nested dictionary in Python. I hope you guys are clear with the agenda. Also, I suggest you to subscribe to the Edureka channel to kickstart your learning and also press the bell icon to get the latest updates from Edureka now without any further ado. Let's try to understand what is a dictionary in Python. So what is a dictionary in Python? It is a collection data type just like a set or a list, but there are certain features that makes dictionary unique. So let's take a look at the features of Python dictionary guys. First of all, it is unordered and we can change values in a dictionary as well since it is mutable. Also, it has key value pairs, which is like a map that we have in other programming languages and it is indexed as well since the keys are distinct and can be used as indexes to access or change any values in the dictionary. A dictionary does not have any duplicate members as well. Now that we know what dictionary in Python is. Let's talk about why we use a dictionary in Python. First of all, the reason would be it is unordered and stores data like a map. So it is one unique feature that Python dictionary has and it also contains the key value pairs unlike any other data type or object in Python. It is almost similar to a real life dictionary where we have distinct values and corresponding to these values. There are respective definitions in case of the dictionary, even though there are no duplicate members. We can mention duplicate members in the values, but the keys has to be unique in order to access these members since there are no indexes also we use the keys as indexes when accessing these elements now that we have learned about why we use a dictionary. Let's understand how it is different from a list in Python. So I've listed down these differences between a list and additionaries. So first of all list is ordered but the dictionary is not dictionary is actually unordered guys. The next one is list has indexes but in order to access elements in a dictionary, we use the keys as indexes. The next one would be the list is collection of elements, but in dictionary we have the key value pairs as elements, which is unlike any other data type or object in Python. The next one is list is often preferred for ordered data, but dictionary is preferred when the data has unique key values. So this actually differentiates a list from a dictionary guys and the next one is list have duplicate elements as well. But in dictionary we do not have any duplicate elements when we are declaring the keys, although we can have duplicate members when we are specifying the values for each key. So these are the differences between a dictionary and a list guys. I hope you are clear with the difference between those two not that we have understood what a dictionary is in Python and why we use it and how it is different from a list. Let's try to understand how we implement a dictionary in Python. So first of all to declare a dictionary in Python. We have to use the curly brackets just like you can see in the example here. I have the dictionary with the name my dictionary and inside those I have the key value pairs inside the curly brackets. So let's take it up to pycharm guys to understand how we implement a dictionary in Python. Let's enter the presentation mode guys. So we will try to implement a dictionary here. Let's take the name of the dictionary as a so inside the curly brackets. I can give the key value pairs. So I'll give one as my first key. So when I am specifying the key value pairs, I have to use the colon to separate the key from the value. Now. I'll give one value over here. Now when we are declaring a dictionary we have to separate these key value pairs with a comma. I'll give another key give it a value. Let's say data science. I'll give one more key and give it a value. Let's say Python. So this is my dictionary guys. This is how you actually implement a dictionary. I have declared a dictionary over here. Now. Let's try to understand how I'm going to access these elements. So I'll just write a inside the square brackets. I'll specify the key value. So I'll put it inside a print statement guys. Now as you can see when I run this I will get the value that is specified in the first key value, which is a direct. I can simply just print all of my dictionary guys. So this is how I'm going to get the output as when I print the dictionary that I've just specified now to access these elements. I can also use the get function and inside the get function. I'll just specify the key value and when I run this I will get the same output and as I was getting using the square brackets guys. So this is how you access elements inside the dictionary. Now I can also replace values inside a dictionary guys since it is mutable. So instead of data science, let's say I want machine learning. So what I'll do is I'll just specify the key value and I'll specify the value that I want to replace it with. Now when I print this you will see the replace value inside the dictionary as you can see here. I have replaced the value inside the dictionary guys. Now if I want to add one more value inside a dictionary, what I'm going to do is I'll just specify the key value that is let's say for because we don't have four over here. So instead of machine learning I'll add the value data science that I have just replaced. Now when I print my dictionary here, let's see what all values I will get. I will get one more value that I have just added which is data science. So this is how you actually implement a dictionary guys and to access these values. You can either use the square brackets and inside those square brackets. You can specify the key value or you can just use the get function and inside the get function. And inside the get function you have to specify the key value as well. So now that we have understood how we can implement a dictionary in Python. Let's try to take a look at the operations that we have in Python dictionary guys. So as I have told already told you how you can actually add an element to your dictionary just like this. I have specified a key value and given it a value and then there is a replacing element which I have already shown you guys. So these are all the operations that we have in Python dictionaries. So we will look at them one by one guys. So let's take it up to pycharm and understand these operations guys. So we'll once again enter the presentation mode. So we have a dictionary over here guys. So first of all, let's talk about clear. So when I use the clear what it's going to do is it is going to remove all the elements from the dictionary. So when I run this so I have a dictionary guys that are already specified. So let's try to print the dictionary first. So you will understand what all these operations are going to do. So I have this dictionary which has these values. All right, so I'll do one thing. I'll use the first operation that is clear. Let's see what it does to our dictionary guys when I run this. Okay. So now when I print my dictionary, let's see what our values I'll get it is saying that it is empty because the clear function has actually deleted or removed all the elements from the dictionary. So this is what clear does guys now, let's take a look at the another one we have also I would want to declare this dictionary once again. And when I print this I should be getting all these values again. Yes, I'm getting these values. So it would be fine if I do one more thing. So I'll just use the copy over here. So what copy does is it returns a copy of the dictionary guys. So let's say when I print be over here, what is going to happen? It is going to show me the copy of this dictionary that I have just specified over here using the copy function. So let's take a look at the next one we have which is the values. So when we are using the values function, what it's going to do is it is going to return all the values inside the dictionary guys. So when I run this it will print all the dictionary values inside a list which is a Eureka data science and Python. So we'll look at the next one we have which is the update function. So what does update function do update function actually updates the values of the dictionary with the specified key value pairs. Let's see if I use update just like this what will happen. We have no updates which is it is showing that we haven't updated anything. So this is what update does guys if we have made any updates it will update the changes into the dictionary. So we look at the next function that we have which is actually get function. I've shown you how to use the get function. We will just use the get function to get the values and inside this I just specify the key value and it will return the value with the specified key, which is actually a Eureka. So this is how you actually access the elements using the get function. Next one is the items function guys. So I'll just use items over here and inside this I will get the list for a couple of each key value pair guys. So let's run this. So when I run this I'm getting couple of each key value pair as you can see over here. I have to then have the value then I have one more key. So this is a couple of each key value pair which we can get using the items function now coming back to the next one that we have which is the keys function. So what it will do is it will actually return all the keys inside the dictionary that we have which is one two three guys. So this is all about keys function guys. So let's talk about the pop function guys. So when I use the pop function what it will do is it will actually pop the value with the specified key. So I'll just pop this from the dictionary with the value 3. So as you can see I'm getting that value over here guys. Now, let's take a look at the next function that we have or the operation which is pop items guys. So when I'm using the pop item function, I can actually remove the last inserted key value pair. So I don't have to specify any values over here. As you can see I'm getting the couple of the last key value pair. I have specified inside the dictionary. So this is what pop item does now the next function that we have is set default guys. So what set default does is it returns the value of the specified key if the key does not exist. We can insert the key with the specified value. So I'll specify the value over here. Let's say one now when I print this I'm getting a diracai as well. So when I specify the next key it is showing me. Okay, it's syntax error. I'm getting the next value. So this is what set default is used for which returns the value of the specified key guys. So this is all about the operations that we have in a dictionary guys. There is one more thing to discuss about the dictionary guys, which is the dictionary constructor. So the dictionary constructor is actually used to declare a dictionary guys. So let's take it up to pycharm again. So I'll show you what a dictionary constructor does. So I'll use a I'll use okay. I'll use my dictionary as my variable dictionary name and I'll use the dictionary constructor over here. I'll specify the values. So what I'm going to do is I'll just specify the values. I will use the keys as let's say key one only and then I'll give it a value. Let's say and Eureka now I can give another key value. Let's say 2 and I'll give it a value. Let's say Python now. Let's see if I can get a dictionary from this. So using the dictionary constructor, let's see if we have actually implemented a dictionary over here. So as you can see I have declared a dictionary using the dictionary constructor guys. So when I run this I should be getting a dictionary here. So as you can see I have declared a dictionary using the dictionary constructor also one more thing. I have missed over here when I was explaining the operations guys. So which is the from keys operation. So I'll declare one more dictionary over here. Give it a value. Let's say one two. I'm giving it a random values guys. Don't be alarmed now when I'm using the from keys keyword what I do is I'll just say a dot from. Okay, we don't have a over here. So I'll write a from keys. I'll specify my dictionary over here. So let's see what happens guys. Okay. I'll so I'll just use the print statement and inside this I will use the from keys and inside this I'll specify my dictionary. Let's see what happens when I run this. So I'm getting a dictionary with the specified keys and values. So as we don't have any key one key to inside this so we are getting the non value over here. So this is what from keys does inside a dictionary guys. So now that we have actually learned what is a dictionary and how we can implement it in Python and all sorts of operations that we can perform on a dictionary. Let's try to understand what are nested dictionary guys. So for this I have a problem statement guys. So now that we know that ICC cricket World Cup is just around the corner guys. So what we'll do is we will implement a dictionary with the stats of the 15 members from the Indian cricket squad for the World Cup 2019 and we will use the concept of nested dictionary in the use case. So what we'll do is we'll implement a dictionary first and then we will make the unique keys to access those values when we are actually getting the elements from the dictionary and then we will store the data inside the dictionary and we will also import a pandas package and convert those data into a data frame for better display statistics. So let's take it up to pie charm guys. So okay, let's exit the presentation mode. So over here I have the value or the dictionary that I've implemented. So let's shake it up to and presentation mode again. So as you can see I have this module that I have actually imported from pandas and I have given it an alias as PD. So we'll talk about this later. So this is my dictionary guys in which I have made four more dictionaries guys, which is actually are nested dictionaries. So first key is batsman inside the batsman key. I have all those batsman like roicharma see and Virat Kohli and inside those values. I have one more dictionary in which we have the statistics for all those matches run savage highest score. So actually inside this batsman key. I have two more dictionary guys. So this is the concept of nested dictionary. So similarly I have made it for all rounder and we have wicked keepers and bowlers as well. So this is my dictionary guys that I have actually stored all the data using the dictionary or as you can say nested dictionary and then I have all these statements that I have written in which I have converted the data inside the dictionary into a data frame guys. So I have this print statement. So first of all, let me print the batsman squad in which we will get the values for all the batsmen that we have inside the World Cup squad. So as you can see I'm getting a data frame over here. So I have these values. We have roicharma Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli. So as you can see we have average highest score matches and runs over here. So for Virat Kohli, we have more than 10,000 runs Shikhar Dhawan has 5,000 runs and roicharma has around 8,000 runs guys. So let's try to understand more from the dictionary that I have just mentioned over here. We have got all the batsmen now. We will try to get all the bowlers. So I'll just print this statement and it will show me all the bowlers statistics, which is cool deep. Yadav Muhammad Shami Bhubaneshwar Kumar use Wayne's child. So we have all these statistics in which we have average. We have best figures then we have matches and wickets as well. So as you can see we have Bhubaneshwar Kumar with the most wickets, which is 118 wickets guys. So this is what you can actually do using the nested dictionaries guys as you can see. This is an unordered data, but we have key value pairs which actually helps in retrieving the data very easily guys. So let's say inside bowler. I want just Pete Brumrah or for all-rounder. I want Hardik Pandya all these statements. I can use it for getting all those values inside a data frame now that we have come to the end of the session. I hope you guys are clear with the concept of dictionaries in Python guys. If you have any questions, you can put it in the comment section and we will get back to you as soon as possible. Thank you.
