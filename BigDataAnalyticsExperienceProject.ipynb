Image Segmentation Hi everybody If youre looking to become a fulltime data scientist and artificial intelligence AI expert from scratch then you are at the right place Today Ill explain the difference between object detection and image segmentation Some computer vision models can detect objects determine their shape and predict the direction in which they will travel For example such models are at work in selfdriving cars Three important tasks undertaken by computer vision are classification object detection image segmentation Classification is a machine learning task for determining which objects are in an image or video It refers to training machine learning models with the intent of finding out which classes objects are present Classification is useful at the yesno level of deciding whether an image contains an object or not A separate task from classification is localization or determining the position of the classified objects in the image or video Object recognition is the technique of identifying the object present in images and videos It is one of the most essential applications of machine learning and deep learning The goal of this field is to teach machines to understand recognize the content of an image just like humans do When we talk about object detection we generally talk about bounding boxes Bounding boxes are generally defined by the position of the top left corner and a width and height The logic of object detection by bounding boxes can be understood if we go back to the task identify all humans on a picture The first intuition of a solution could be to cut the image in small parts and apply on each subimage an image classification to say whether this image is a human or not Classifying a single image is an easier task and of object detection therefore they took this stepbystep approach Currently speaking the YOLO model has been a great invention that solves this problem The developers of the YOLO model have built a neural network that is capable of doing the whole bounding box approach at once Current best models for object detection are YOLO faster RCNN You may face two major challenges while working on object detection those are in object detection the bounding boxes are always rectangular So it does not help with determining the shape of objects if the object contains the curvature part Object detection cannot accurately estimate some measurements such as the area of an object perimeter of an object from an image Image segmentation is a further extension of object detection in which we mark the presence of an object through pixel wise masks generated for each object in the image This technique is more granular than bounding box generation because this can help us in determining the shape of each object present in the image This granularity helps us in various fields such as medical image processing satellite imaging etc There are primarily two types of segmentation Semantic segmentation it refers to the process of linking each pixel in the given image to a particular class label For example in this image the pixels are labeled as car tree pedestrian etc These segments are then used to find the interactions between various objects Instance segmentation here we associate a class label to each pixel similar to semantic segmentation except that it treats multiple objects of the same class as separate entities Theres another advanced type of segmentation known as panoptic segmentation It is a combination of instance and semantic segmentation in a way that we associate with each pixel two values its class label and an instance number It also recognizes the sky the road and other background elements collectively known as stuff The logical alternative for scanning the image step by step is to stay away from drawing boxes but rather to annotate an image pixel by pixel If you do this you are going to have a more detailed model which is basically a transformation of the input image The idea is basic even when scanning a bar code on a product it is possible to apply an algorithm that transforms the input by applying all sorts of filters so that all information other than the barcode sequence becomes invisible in the final picture This is the basic approach of locating a barcode on an image but is comparable to what happens in image segmentation The return format of image segmentation is called a mask an image that has the same size as the original image but for each pixel it has simply a boolean indicating whether the object is present or not present It can be made more complicated if we allow for multiple categories The discussed object recognition techniques can be utilized in many fields such as driver less cars object recognition is used for detecting road signs other vehicles etc Medical image processing object recognition and image processing techniques can help detect disease more accurately For example Google AI for breast cancer detection detects more accurately than doctors Surveillance and security such as face recognition object tracking activity recognition etc If youre interested in learning more about starting a machine

hug theyre not obviously the same hug or obviously the same thing and thats one of the real difficulties in knot theory is this knot the same as another knot So something you can look at is colouring knots Im pretty sure youve got plenty videos on colouring knots But you look for an invariance something that doesnt change so in the physical world if youre hugging Its great because you can you can untangle it you can retangle it Youre like this is the same knot no matter what I do because nobodys unheld hands It is the same knot But if youre looking at these this knot here is not Necessarily the same as Ill draw another one here which is the same knot but you might not recognize it as the same Okay Okay let me just check my over unders over under over under oh under under Well heres how I can tell if its the same knot but from a different view we can three colour it So Im colouring a knot is an invariant So if you can do the same thing here and the same thing here then they are the same knot So like on this knot here I could Make this a kind of green and blue section And I could do that for say this bit here Green and blue I Can make this one a pinky section and lets go with this one being a pinky section And then youve got just your normal blue section So this is three colourable This is three colourable and they are theyre the same knot Theyve got an invariance They look like different knots and they would look like different hugs They are the same knot I have tried this is gonna make me sound like such a sad person Ive tried to do these hug knots on my own It doesnt work What do you even do well so this this Trefoil knot the three one knot is sometimes called the overhand knot and like as if you were to tie an overhand shoelace or Just like fold your arms Thats the start of an overhand knot So if I could fold my arms like this and like somehow get my hands to reach together I know I know I cant do it Thats why mathematicians need friends But yeah So that if my hands could reach together would be the same knot and with the chirality as well The opposite way of folding your arms again if I could reach my hands together would be the same knot But you do you need friends for this kind of maths you need This hand would have to come Around yeah to this this hand here Yeah and then doing it the other way around is also horrible Yeah and then I also for a while thought that I might be able to do a kind of a kind of knot But its not it turns out just to be the same as the unknot You see my weird trick So if you do this let me see if I can do this with it ruining my hair I hope this isnt the weirdest thing thats happened on a numberphile video Im in the top ten So this I thought might be a knot that I could do myself Its not a knot because what youre doing there is called a Reedmeister move So if I take from this it looks like there might be a loop or a knot or something But you can actually it is just a knot unfortunately so you do need you do need buddies to do this Other than getting wonderful hugs from my mom Why would I spend my time like trying to figure out weird knot things and both parts there knots and chirality I have really interesting developing parts of maths that are going on right now So for example the chirality issue thats applicable in chemistry physics biology all of the sciences But you want to bring it down into the real world like as youve seen there are things which in maths world are possible Because we tend to think of strings or ribbons as having zero width so anything can happen But could that actually work in the real world Can you give yourself a trefoil hug in the real world No someone had to try it It doesnt work I know that now and but with chemistry you can get two different chemical molecules Which are the exact same molecules But have a chirality a lefthanded and a righthandness and they smell totally different You can get one that smells of lemon and orange same molecule different smells or in an even more serious situation You can have medicines which work well But their chiral molecule could be either completely ineffective or very harmful So that kind of serious chirality consideration is what led to the thalidomide disaster and They had two different isomers of the same molecule same medicine but one was lefthanded one was righthanded They thought well cover both bases put them both in but it turns out that one of them It does have disastrous effects unfortunately and the other one would work very well as a medicine But we kind of avoid that now Chirality and knots I think youve got videos as well about knots being used in DNA Theres all kinds of longchain polymer molecules These are things which happen in the real world Its all hugs and fun in maths world But is it gonna work for our scientists and I think when it comes to current developments everything that comes from here on in is gonna be as a result of interdisciplinary learning people working together with mathematicians and Biology chemistry physics science theres some amazing things going on with a maths and anatomy or biology right now So if you think you are not a maths person like my mum did you probably are it you just need to look at it in the right way and If you are a maths person you need to find someone whos not a maths person and give them a hug get them involved in the maths world because All of the amazing things that are to come from here on in are gonna be collaborations with maths and everyone else And then youre Into the trefoil hug I made it for you but youd rather just a normal hug Piece wise but just slower than this top one and it goes from the other direction All of the purple pieces as I solve it theyre moving in a little cycle Theyre going a b c a b c\",\n          \"Hello everyone This is was seen from Edureka and in this session we will be focusing on variables and data types in Python So lets take a look at the agenda for this session First Ill be giving you a brief introduction to Python followed by a few applications of Python programming language moving Further we will talk about the rules and regulations that we have to follow while declaring a variable after we are done with that We will talk about various variable data types that we have in Python and we will also run a few examples in the Jupiter notebook as well And finally I will sum up this session with type conversion I hope youre clear with the agenda So lets quickly move on to introduction to Python Python is a generalpurpose programming language which has become so popular among the developers nowadays So lets understand what makes Python unique or what has made it popular among the developers First of all Python is a highlevel interpreted language which means it does not require any compilation just like PHP or JavaScript I can has a very clear syntax and readability which has made Python very easy to learn It is almost as easy as writing a program in simple English language Everybody can learn Python even children going to school can learn Python It is that easy We can use Python as an objectoriented programming language or we can also use it as a procedure oriented language as well One more thing with Python is that we can run it on different platforms For example we can run it on Windows We can run it on Linux We can run it on Mac as well Now lets suppose youre writing a program in Java and you have to write 50 to 60 line of codes But what if I tell you you can do the same thing in Python with lesser line of codes maybe 10 or 15 line of codes Yes it is possible and this has given Python and edge over other programming languages And that is the reason why people are switching over to Python because they dont want to put effort into development of complex programs They want to put the effort at the implementation part and that is where Python actually delivers Now lets talk a little about the history of Python It was created in 1991 by a Dutch guy named guide of one Rossum It has a rather funny story attached to its name also So our creator here was very fond of a comedy series called Monty Python So therefore the name has come from over there Now lets talk about a few applications I have listed for you guys Let me tell you guys we have web frameworks in Python For example we have Django or we have flask as well which we can use for serverside web development We also have a wide variety of Python libraries at our disposal which we can use for general purposes For example we have a TK inter Python library that we can use for GUI based desktop applications or for software development as well with the easy syntax that we have in Python We just have to focus on the creativity part We dont have to worry about making any mistakes in the syntax or any of that sort We can also use Python for databases to update or modify the value in the database For example we have my SQL which is the most popular open source database which we use for storing the Python data as Ive already told you guys Python is an interpreted language So what it means is it does not require any compilation which makes it perfect for scripting We can write long Python scripts for code reusability and automation of task We can also use Python for prototyping For example we have a numpy library which is written in C programming language but we can use it in Python to fast things up And finally we can also use Python in big data as well for its inbuilt features and easy access For example we have pandas matplotlib and scipy libraries which we can use for scientific computations or for statistics or we can use it for data visualization or data analysis and we can use pandas for as little as loading a file into the program So this was all about introduction to Python and its applications So lets quickly move on to variable declaration First of all we have to understand what a variable is a variable is like a memory location where you store a value now this value you have stored You may or may not change in the future now coming back to Python to declare a variable We just have to assign a value to it You dont have to give any additional commands unlike the programming languages like C C Java where you have to give additional commands for declaration and assignment purposes Lets take a look at an example here We have two variables X and Y and we have assigned values to each of them We have given 100 to X and a Dureka to Y So this is actually how you create a variable in Python Now when I print these variables I am going to get the output as hundred and a Dureka You can also perform operations on these variables using the arithmetic operators You can perform addition multiplication subtraction or division as well Now lets try to understand this in the Jupiter notebook as well First of all what Im going to do is Im going to declare a variable without assigning a value to it Lets see what happens It is going to show an error the error says name X is not defined So lets try again after giving it a value Lets say X is equal to 10 It does not give any errors now So we have successfully declared a variable here Let me declare one more variable Okay Ill give it a value 12 Now lets try to perform a few operations on these variables First of all lets just perform addition between X and Y Now lets try to do multiplication Theres one more thing I want to tell you about variable declaration that is variables in Python are case sensitive meaning an uppercase letter here is not going to be the same as a lowercase letter They are going to be two different variables Let me show you it is showing another error which is saying name Y is not defined because we have not assigned a value to uppercase letter Y Let me give this another value here Let me give it 20 So we have declared two variables here a lowercase value Y and uppercase value Y which are going to be two different variables So we have understood here the variable declaration how we declare a variable now lets quickly move on to various variable data types that we have in Python depending upon the properties they possess there are mainly six data types in Python First one is the numbers or numerical data type The next one is the string then we have a list after that we have a dictionary followed by a tuple and in the last we have a set there is one more variable data type that is range We will talk about that in the end because it is mainly used when we are iterating through values or when we are using the for loop So lets try to understand all these in detail numbers or numerical data types mainly have numerical values and in numbers also we have four different data types that is integer float complex and Boolean So integer mainly takes the whole number values without any decimal point values But if I add a decimal point value to a number it is going to become float and for complex We just use J as an imaginary part and add it to the number for Boolean it only returns a true or a false So we use Boolean for only categorical output Now lets try to understand this in Jupiter notebook First of all let me declare a variable X and give it an integer value Lets say 10 now to check the type of a variable I am going to use the type function So it is going to show me the type of this variable Lets say X that is int now if I add a decimal point value to X lets say 1025 and lets check the type of this variable Now we should get float as you can see We are getting float here now to make a number complex Im just going to add an imaginary part that is J here Lets check the type of this variable It is going to show complex number to understand the Boolean variable Let me take another variable Now Im going to check if 10 is greater than 9 or not So when I check the type of this variable here it is going to show me that it is a Boolean and when I print this value it is either going to show me true or false since 10 is greater than 9 it is showing true as output So this was all about numerical data types Now lets quickly move on to string data type string data type in Python is written in single or double quotes as you can see here in the example that I have shown you I have two variables X and Y and I have given them the string values Hello and world now to access the string values We use the square brackets with the index number Now you must be wondering what our index number is So lets take a look at an example here Ill show you what index numbers are in the Jupyter Notebook Now let me declare a variable and give it a string value Lets say at Eureka Now let me check the length of this string Lets say so it has a length of 7 now What are index numbers So index numbers basically start from 0 so at the letter E here index number is going to be 0 and it is going to go until the end of the string So here at the end is the letter a so index number at the letter A is going to be 6 since we have the length of the string as 7 and the index numbers start from 0 now lets try to access some values from the string using the index number So when I write the index number as to I am going to get the value at the index number that is to which is letter you now We can also perform several operations on strings For example we can change the case of the string We can replace the values in the string We are going to see if we can actually replace values in the strings or not So lets try to update a value here at the index number 2 here So instead of you lets say I want be here It is going to show an error which is a type error which says string object does not support item assignment which means strings are immutable You cannot change them now to access a series of letters from a string I can specify a starting index and with the colon here I can specify the ending index as well Lets say I write 8 but we only have seven indexes here Lets see what is going to happen here So it has actually started from the index to that is you here and has gone to the end of the string But what if I write ending index as 7 since we have the length of the string as 7 Lets see what it going to do It is going to show the same thing But what if I write 6 over there It is not going to include the last letter because the ending index there is not going to include when we are accessing the values from the string Now lets try to do one more thing here Lets try to make all the letters here to uppercase letters as you can see Ive done that similarly I can make all the letters to lowercase as well So this was all about string data type Okay one more thing I want to tell you here is to access the values from the end of the string I can specify the index number using the minus here So what Im going to get here is starting from the end of the string Im going to get the two letters there that is at the index number 5 that is K Similarly if I write name specify the index number 2 here it is going to give me the same value So we can also access the values in the string like that also So this was all about string data type Now lets quickly move on to list data type a list is a collection of arrays which is changeable and ordered which means they have indexes just like strings So we use the square brackets to declare a list as you can see here I have the list name fruits and inside the square brackets I have the list values now We have to understand that we can declare different data types in the list not just strings or not just integers We can merge integers and string as well or we can also use other data types in the list as well So Im going to show you this in the Jupiter notebook So lets declare a list first Give it some integer values first Some duplicate values as well Lets just see what happens and a string value as well As you can see we have successfully declared a list now when I print the list lets see what all values I will get So I am getting all the values that have declared here Now let me try to access the values using the index number just like we did in the string as you can see we can access the values in the list just like we did in the strings as well using the index number Now we can also update the values in the list using the index number as well So lets just try to update the value at index number 2 So instead of 30 I want 35 over there So lets just see what it does as you can see We have successfully updated our value in the list Now lets try to add a value using append So what append does is it will add the value at the end of the list Now let me show you so there is a value at the end of the list that we have added using the append function Now what if I want to add the value at the middle of the list using the index number So what Im going to do is Im going to use the insert function specify the index number and give it a value is just say hundred now when I print the list as you can see at the index number 5 I have added hundred as our value So the difference between the insert and append is that using the append you can only add the value at the end of the list but when youre using insert you can add the value specifying the index number now let me do a few operations here Let me try to reverse the list here using the reverse function Now when I print this the list is reverse So this was all about list here Lets quickly move on to dictionary now a dictionary is a collection just like a list but it is unordered changeable and indexed So we have a key value pair in a dictionary and we can use the keys as indexes because they are unique but the values in the keys can be duplicate as you can see in the example here I have the dictionary name as animals and in the curly brackets I have declared the key value pairs So lets try this in the jupyter notebook as well So Ill declare a dictionary here Lets just say courses is my dictionary inside the curly brackets I will get key values Lets just say one and give it a value comma key value That is to and then Ill give another value Lets just say data science I can give string values in the key as well So Im going to write here machine learning Now lets see if we have a successfully declared our dictionary Yes we have lets try to print the dictionary now as you can see I am getting all these values with key value pairs Now I can access the values in the dictionary using the keys as indexes Ill just write third over here As you can see Im getting the value at the key that is third now for the similar purpose I can use the get function and specify the key value there It is going to show me the same value now to update a value in the dictionary Im just going to write the index number that is our key value here So instead of machine learning lets just say Hadoop All right so when I print the dictionary now it is going to show me an updated value Also I can add the key value pairs using the square brackets Ill just specify the key value Lets just say for here Ill add machine learning again Okay one second We have made a mistake here We wrote the wrong name Now as you can see we have added another value to our dictionary So this was all about dictionary guys Lets quickly move on to tuple a tuple is an ordered and unchangeable Now what it means is it is immutable just like a string We cannot make any changes in the tuple but we can have the duplicate values in the tuple as well So lets try to understand this with an example So I have a tuple here which has a name animals and I have few values here So lets just do this in Jupiter notebook as well So Ill have my tuple as a name animals So Ill give it a value in round brackets a few integer values first just to check off course and then Ill add some values like Tiger Ill just say lion and one more Ill give lets say giraffe Now let me give a duplicate value here to check if we can actually add a duplicate value or not Ill say Tiger once again So I have successfully created a tuple here Now let me access the values here using the index number Lets see if we can do that So this actually means the tuples are indexed as well We can use the index values to access the values from the tuple now since it is immutable or we cannot change it There are not many operations that you can perform on a tuple but you can count the number of duplicate values using the count function So youre just going to write the value Lets say Tiger we have duplicate value over there So we will check how many times Tiger is there So its going to give us the count here So this was all about tuple guys So lets quickly move on to set now now a set is a collection just like a list or a dictionary as well but it is unordered and there are no duplicate entries present Now let me show you this with an example in the Jupiter notebook So Ill give my set as the set name and inside the curly brackets We can have values Lets just say 10 20 30 40 Ill also give a few duplicate values just to check if we can have duplicate values or not sing value Just say a dereka courses as you can see We have successfully declared a set here Now let me try to print this now as you can see there are no duplicate values even though when we have declared the set it was there now let me try to access the values using the index numbers It has shown us an error which says set object does not support indexing which means a set does not have any indexes and every time we print a set it is going to show us a random value So this was all about set guys briefly talk about range now So range is used whenever we are iterating through values Suppose we want to print numbers from 0 to 10 Let me put it in a list to get the values So what Im going to do is Ill just write 11 over here and it is going to give me the values in the list that is from 0 to 10 So this is all about range guys Now let me take a miscellaneous example Now Ill have a dictionary with some values again and DJ values Now let me try to make a list and try to get the values from A and B as well Lets see if we can do that Now when I print see here it is going to show me that our list C has the list a and a dictionary as well So which shows you can actually make a list with other data types For example you can actually incorporate a dictionary over there You can also do that with the tuple or a set and if you want some value that you dont want to change in the future you can actually make it a tuple and declare it in the list so that you cannot change that value in the future For example if you dont want to access any value using the indexes you can make it with set so that it does not have any indexes So that is all about data types guys So there is one more topic that I want to talk about which is type conversion Now suppose we have an integer here that has 10 value and we have a string as well which says now when I try to add these two variables name and X it is going to show me a type error which says unsupported operand types now for this error I am going to do a type conversion here So lets quickly talk about type conversion before moving on to the example So type conversion is basically when you convert a type of a variable to another data type So we have all these functions here which will convert the data type into their respective counterparts Now lets try to look at the example now So we are getting an error here But what if I change the data type of integer into string Am I going to get the same error again or not Lets just see Were not going to get any errors So this is what is all about type conversion Let me show you one more example So we had a dictionary over there that is with the name be what Im going to do is Im going to use the list function and specify be over there So I have actually converted our dictionary into a list So this is what is type conversion all about now We have come to the end of the session guys If you have any questions you

buy And Im going to be using a string here So I have a shopping list maybe I need eggs eggs I might need some carrots oh I need milk cherries and lets add one more apples So lets say I had to go to a shopping store and I had all these different items that I had to buy So right now what the problem is is that if I need to know whats the first item in my list what do I have remaining Stuff like that I cant do that with a string Right now if I just want to find out whats my first item Ill have to do shopping list and then use some spicing stuff but that also depends on if I know the number of characters Right now if I just print shopping list Im just going to get egg carrots milk cherries and apples Theres no specific way to find out whats my first item whats my third item whats the last item I have to get And this is where the Python term lists and the more general term arrays comes in So again lets create a new list shopping list 20 or 2 And lets create an array over here And the way to create an array is were going to be using two square brackets And in the square brackets youre now going to add your items So our first item was eggs our second item was carrots third item was milk cherries apples So these lists right theyre the most versatile data type available in Python All the items and the items in the list can be of any data type strings numbers etc but they can be So this is our shopping list in which weve used an array Now for example if I print out shopping list 20 what do I get I get eggs carrots milk cherries apples in square brackets And now youre wondering hey whats the difference in shopping list 20 and shopping list 10 The only difference I can see is that were adding these square brackets Well guys the whole point of arrays is that we can now use indexing to get our values Whenever you create an array and again in arrays you can add any value whatsoever You could have added integers floats you could have added decimal values stuff like that into the array Right now since its a shopping list Ive used strings But the whole point of arrays is theyve given each value an index number So Im at the grocery store and Ive checked mark eggs but Im not sure what is my next item in my list So what we can do now is if we do shopping list 20 and then in square brackets right next to it 20 we get milk So youre probably wondering well why didnt we get carrots Its a second value Well think about it like this Just like we talked about characters in the last lecture with lists its the exact same thing The indexing in a list in a string in almost all data types in Python it starts at zero So the eggs index is zero If I want to know what is my first item in my list Im going to use shopping list 20 and then in square brackets the first item which is zero If I want to find out hey whats my fourth item in my list Im going to say shopping list 20 and then n minus 1 If I want to know the fourth its 4 minus 1 3 So shopping list 30 its cherries So this is where lists become more and more useful And this isnt the end Theres tons of functions you can add with lists Right now all weve done is weve accessed values Lets say I was at the grocery store and Im like wait I dont need milk anymore I realized I have two cartons at home Instead I need chocolate How do I update the value in list Right now if we were using a string there was no way we could do that Wed have to rewrite the string over and over again Waste of time However with lists its quite simple First find the position Whats our position Its going to be 2 So all were going to say here is shopping list 20 should now be equal to chocolate Do you see what we did there What were saying oh string object does not support item assignment Oh the error I was getting here is sorry about that Its shopping list 20 since the variable name was shopping list 20 So here in case I want to change milk to chocolate now typing in chocolate again And if I print out shopping list 20 we get eggs carrots chocolate cherries apples Isnt that cool So you can update values in lists You can change You can delete You can add These lists are the most versatile object youll find in Python And as we get along in the course as we add or dive deeper into Python list will be one of the main objects we use every day So play around with this And in the next lecture Ill be showing you some cool functions that we can use with lists See you then\n",
            "Reference summary for training sample 286: Well hello internet and welcome to part eight of my Python for Finance video tutorial series In the last video I showed you how to create efficient portfolios using the Markowitz portfolio optimization technique And then we looked at the Sharpe ratio What Im going to do in this video is we are going to search the entire market so that we can create the most optimized portfolios to maximize return while minimizing your overall risk Im going to talk again more about the Sharpe ratio And then Im also going to show you how to automatically generate the optimized weighting to create your portfolio so that you know exactly how many shares to buy And I have a lot to do so lets get into it Alright so previously in part four I showed you how to go and find those sector stocks being stocks that fit into certain sectors being technology healthcare financials and all these other different ones and then find those who had the highest ROI Now our job here is to try to create like a super portfolio So what I did was I took the top 30 or more of these different sector stocks plugged them in and I had about 400 different stocks And you can see the tickers and all that And then from that point what I did was I had you know I generated portfolios like I did previously in the last video efficient portfolios that maximize return and minimize risk Well then what I did was in those situations because I want this portfolio to be small I dont want to buy 400 stocks I might as well just go and get an index if I want to do that So what I wanted to do was I got the list of securities And lets say that after I ran the test I had 40 of them Well in situations in which I had stocks that were you know quite a bit under 1 allocation wise I eliminated them And then I ran my tests again to create another efficient portfolio And I did this over and over and over again until I got this core group of stocks that showed great return All right And Im not just going to show you code here Im going to actually write code because what Im going to do after this is after it gives you a recommendation for the securities to purchase and the percentages to purchase Im going to show you or Im going to create a whole bunch of functions that are going to automatically generate how many shares you need to buy to approximate the efficient portfolio Okay So everything else here is exactly the same as the last video here or all of the prices changes for all of our different securities And this is the updated list the brand new list of best of best at least you know based off my calculations And again we have a new plot here with all of our different securities starting at 100 so you can see that growth And all of this code is of course this whole entire file and everything here is on GitHub for free Its in the description So if you want to look at it I help a lot Okay I went and got mean returns just like before covariances to make sure that we have noncorrelated assets in our portfolio And more importantly correlation shows this a lot better So what we want to do is try to get assets that are below 05 in all of these different columns as much as humanly possible And that is going to make our portfolio less risk adverse And here what I did was generate random weights Here is the return of the portfolio There is the volatility of the portfolio You can see here this is when I was generating all those There is the efficient frontier with all those 10000 different portfolios made up of those individual securities And then we applied the Sharpe ratio again just like we did in the last video And from that we were able to generate the key great portfolio that matches closest with this And you can see here we have a 24 volatility and a return of 379 Lets see if we can find that here So 24 and 37 Im guessing it is this guy right here And you can see it is way off of there Okay So that is definitely a very efficient portfolio All right So what are we going to do now Well our goal here now is we know what percentages to buy for each of these securities Well the only problem is every single security isnt priced at the same price Theyre all over the place And what we need to do is we need to come in here and actually figure out how much or how many shares of each of these securities we need to buy to get close to 2472 for example Okay And thats the percentage that we need of the GNRC stock 16 for the next 68 Da da da So what Im going to do is Im going to create a function that is going to do that Now every single time I run this code I get a slightly different portfolio So I decided to use this mixture of securities And what I want to do here is I want to try and get as close as possible buying individual shares of these securities Yes I know you can buy fractional shares but this is something that I a question that was requested of me and Im going to fulfill it Okay So what were going to do here first I want to think about you know like whats going on So PG stock is very close to one So Im just going to say its one All right But as youre going to see my function is going to be its all gone close to being perfect Okay So Im off by 09 Thats not really going to affect the overall risk and return of this portfolio All right So what do we have Well we have 118 This is what our function is going to do Its going to take 118 and because that represents the price for PG stock and its going to multiply it times 22 So times 22 Im explaining the code that Im going to create Now if we do this we get 26004 and then what we want to do is we want to divide that by the value of the GNRC stock which is priced at 10201 Now if we do that what were going to get is an answer of 2549 So that means to approximate based off of Procter and Gamble being 1 and this being almost 22 What we want to do is figure out how many shares of GNRC we need to buy to meet our requirement of getting 22 Well the answer to that is 25 shares And then what we need to do is just simply multiply that times 10201 and whenever we do that that will give us the total amount that we are going to invest in GNRC stock And in situations in which like for example COG or I think Charter causes some problems because of its price In situations in which prices just will not work what Im going to do with our function is Im going to say guarantee we get at least one of those securities And lets see how it works out So Im going to create basically everything you see right here down here in a way that is going to work with an entire portfolio So Im going to call this get port shares like this and this is going to represent the price of the 1 stock So PG stock is going to be passed inside of here and its going to be used as a model right here So were going to get past that value and what else are we going to pass Well do we want to force that we definitely will get at least one share of each security Well they can either make this true or false it is up to them Then were going to get an array of weights that we are trying to aim for and an array of prices Okay so now that we have that Im going to keep this on the board because basically what Im doing is Im modeling this calculation down here in the code Alright so what I want to do first is I want to find out the number of stocks that we are going to be analyzing and to do that I can just go equals length and weights exactly like that Alright then I am going to create a list and its going to hold the number of shares for each of those securities This is going to be an updating list I am then also going to have the costs for those securities also updated and then Im going to say i is equal to and Im going to cycle through the weights and the prices and figure this stuff out So Im going to say while i is less than the number of stocks that we want to analyze well So I want to get the maximum amount to spend on a stock and Im just going to call this max price and thats going to be equal to whatever the value is of the PNG stock that was passed in I think you can see right here how Im basically just modeling this Thats whats going on Then what Im going to do is Im going to get my weighting and that is going to update whoops I dont like that there Times the weights and theyre going to update each time Then what I want to do is get the number of shares to buy and add that to the list So Im going to say the number of shares that I need to buy to be able to get as close as possible to that recommended allocation So to do that Im going to convert this answer into an integer because you cant buy fractions of a share at least in my world and Im going to say that is going to be divided by whatever the price is for that security Now what we can do is we can say if the user wants us to always have at least one security and the number of shares after this calculation is equal to zero Well in that situation Im going to mark the number of shares equal to one So that guarantees we have at least one share of every single security and well see how that works out Then I want to append the number of shares to buy for that security to our shares list and then I want to get the cost of those shares and append that to a list So to do so I go cost is equal to the number of shares times the prices I like that and then Im going to say cost and shares and append that cost to it Okay And then I have to of course increment the value of I to get the next security and then after Im done with that I can return both So Im going to say return the list which is shares that I need to buy and the cost per shares Okay So there we go Got that function Well now what I want to do is I want to get my portfolio waiting So Im going to create another function here and its going to say get port and waiting and Im going to be passing in share cost into that and Im going to create another list and this guy waits like this This is just an empty list thats going to be populated I am going to go and Im going to need to go and get the total sum of all the investments in the portfolio So total and I just call sum on the share cost and itll give me the total sum of all the different stocks in that list and I can come in here and maybe I want to print that information out So Ill say total investment So this is going to say the total investment the user is going to have to make with this portfolio to get this allocation Then all I do is I just say for X in and share cost like that and stock waits and append and what I can append is just X divided by whatever the total value of the portfolio is And then after I do all of that for all those different securities I can say that I want to return the stock waits Now I was going to show you the value of the portfolio by date but Im going to leave that till the next video because it makes more sense then So we have our list of securities right here that we went and condensed down into the core stocks we want to buy and then on top of that I have the weightings that I want for each of those securities Then all I did was I rounded these numbers so 219 became 22 16 became this and so forth and so on So now what were going to do is were going to use our functions that we just created to come in here and see how many shares we need to buy of each of the individual securities to get these percentage weightings Alright so pretty good stuff So what Im going to do is Im going to say that I want to create a starting What I want to do is just get all stock prices on my starting date So Im going to go port df start is equal to merge and data frame by column name which is a function I created forever ago in past videos So adjust it close and Im going to get a specific price All I do is I pass in one date instead of passing in two dates So I have 20 this is the very first trading day of 2021 or 2020 So throw that there and I am going to throw in my portfolio list So that is generating that data frame Then what I need to do is I need to convert from this data frame to a regular old python list So Im going to call this port prices portfolio prices obviously and go port data frame start and then you call values and then you say to list like this and its going to create that list The only problem is is its going to create a list inside of a list We dont want that We just want a list So theres a trick you can just go port prices is equal to some like that and this will convert it into a simple python list You just pass in port prices like that and an empty array and that will give us exactly what we want All right So now what I want to do is I want to go and call get port shares this guy right here Im going to pass in the one price which is going to be the price for PG stock Im going to say yes I want to demand that I get at least one of every single security and then I pass in two arrays One of the arrays is the weights for the securities and the prices for said securities and then its going to provide me the information that I want So I is going to provide whoops the total shares that I need to buy to get my allocation that Im looking for and its also going to provide share cost passed back to me So I just go get port shares like this 118 once again is the value of Procter and Gamble stock that were going to use as a baseline for making predictions about all of our other securities and then were going to pass in our weights and our prices exactly like that Okay so now what do we got We got all our information We just need to test it to see if it matches with what we want percentage wise So if I want to print out the shares that I need to buy of each security to try and get as close as humanly possible to that well thats what thats going to do and then I can also go share cost if I want to print out that as well and I just go share cost like that and what else do we need I am going to go and get a list of the weights for the stock so Ill say stock and weights is equal to get port weighting like this and pass in the share cost like that and then I can go and print this out This will be the weights for all of them so Ill just say stock and weights and then I can go stock weights like this and then if I think thats good Alright so lets just keep that there Lets run it see if it worked Actually I think there was one error in my code that I corrected without thinking and it was right here I accidentally whenever I was showing you I accidentally had a W right there so make sure you put an X right there Okay so now lets test our results So these were the percentages we were aiming at and lets see how close we got with our weightings So we wanted 219 of GNRC stock and we got 217 We wanted 156 we got 159 We wanted 23 we got 238 and as you can see everything is working itself out just about perfectly Okay so there you go guys Now you know how to take a mountain of stock how to combine them analyze them find noncorrelated assets combine them into gigantic high return low risk portfolios and you also know how many shares to buy to get this target allocation of stocks So hopefully you find this beneficial and useful and like always please leave your questions and comments down below otherwise until next time\n",

            "Reference summary for training sample 960: This video is sponsored by Great Courses Plus Imagine taking a notebook a plastic bottle a toaster and a glass container and burning them in a fire If the fire was hot enough all the materials in these four things would break down into a gaseous mixture of molecules and atoms If you make this fire hotter all the atoms would break down into their component electrons and neutrons If you go hotter still these particles would break down into the fundamental particles of the standard model things like quarks and leptons And if you go even hotter were talking astronomical temperatures around 10 to 31 degrees or about a million trillion trillion degrees Celsius all the quarks and leptons of the four fundamental forces of nature would break down into one entity a kind of soup where all the fundamental particles and the underlying forces responsible for their behavior would meld into one This is what is believed to have existed at the moment of creation at the moment of the Big Bang All the particles and forces of our reality came from this primordial soup But this is the story of the four fundamental forces of the universe that as far as is known control everything in the universe every movement every phenomenon and every process you can possibly think of What is the nature of these forces How do they work And where do they come from Thats coming up right now What is the nature of the four fundamental forces of the universe According to modern particle theory represented by the standard model of particle physics all matter is composed of six quarks and six leptons and their 12 antiparticle pairs But thats not all Matter is subject to four fundamental forces that cause this matter to behave in certain ways and result in essentially every action that you see all around you and everywhere in the universe These four forces are the strong force which binds the nuclei of atoms by holding protons and neutrons together in their center the weak force which is responsible for some kinds of radioactivity electromagnetism responsible for electricity and light and is also the root cause of chemistry and finally gravity which binds us to the earth and keeps the planets in their orbits around the sun Yet the most interesting aspect of this picture is that at a fundamental level scientists believe that all the forces come from one underlying force or principle And astonishingly not only that but according to current understanding all 24 of the different fundamental particles and the four forces are one and the same at some deep level This is the ultimate symmetry of the universe Perhaps the best way to understand this and how these forces emerged is to visualize what happened at the very beginning of time at the Big Bang when everything was one Time began not at zero but at the smallest measurement of time that can be represented by our models of quantum mechanics and that is Planck time This is not zero but pretty close from our perspective 10 to the negative 43 seconds This is not to say that nothing existed prior to this but it is just the limit of our knowledge We are ignorant of anything that might have occurred prior to this first epoch of existence So this is aptly called the Planck epoch All the forces and particles were one and the same in a point smaller than the size of a proton Gravity is thought to have separated from everything else shortly after this time period So it was the first force to separate out from the other three forces The temperatures at this stage of the universe were as you might expect astronomical 10 to the 31 degrees Celsius and the energies were on the range of 10 to the 19 billion electron volts or giga electron volts If we ever develop a theory of everything then it would explain everything that occurred up to this time The strings of string theory and the loops of loop quantum gravity if those theories are correct come into existence and apply here The next era called the Grand Unified Epoch lasts from the first Planck second 10 to the negative 43 seconds to about 10 to the negative 35 seconds Up to this period the remaining three forces the strong force the weak force and electromagnetism were all united But shortly after this period from about 10 to the negative 34 to 10 to the negative 32 seconds the strong force separated from the other two electromagnetism and the weak force which were united as one force called the electroweak force Temperatures were now around 10 to the 26 degrees Celsius and the energy was reduced to 10 to the 15 giga electron volts If we ever discover the Grand Unified Theory or GUT which unites the strong force with the electroweak force we would need to model what happens at these energy levels and temperatures Somehow the separation of the strong force is thought to have resulted or powered something called cosmic inflation This is the momentary expansion of the universe which went from something tinier than the size of a proton to the size of a grapefruit This is a huge increase in size Its analogous to something as small as a tennis ball becoming the size of the solar system in a very small instant At 10 to the negative 12 seconds called the quark epoch the electroweak force split into the weak force and electromagnetism These two now became separate forces So at this point all the four forces became distinct The temperature of the universe cooled to 10 to the 15 degrees Celsius and energies are about 100 giga electron volts We know a lot about the universe up to this era because such energy levels can be easily modeled in particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider So our understanding of the electroweak force is fairly robust The Higgs field also exists at this stage as well How do we know Because about 100 giga electron volts was needed to create the Higgs boson and this can be done at the LHC Now fast forward to today 138 billion years later where the average temperature of the universe is negative 270 degrees Celsius and energy is on the order of 025 electron volts Lets look closer at the four forces and lets start with the two we are most familiar with gravity and electromagnetism They are similar in that their mathematical formulas look nearly identical In the first formula Newtons law of universal gravitation can be expressed as the following where G is Newtons gravitational constant Coulombs law of electrical force between charged bodies can be expressed as the following where K is Coulombs constant The first formula tells us that the gravitational force between any two bodies is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the distance between them squared Notice that the force extends infinitely far This means that the Earth has a gravitational effect on not just the Moon and the other planets of our solar system but also some effect on every other massive object in the universe Mind you this is a very small effect because the R on the equation would be very large for things very far away So the force would be very weak but it is nonzero Since gravity affects anything with mass this effect is the most influential force on a cosmic scale But almost everything I just said also applies to electromagnetism The electrostatic force between charges extends also infinitely far away This means that a charged particle on Earth has a nonzero effect on a charged particle near Proxima Centauri our nearest neighboring star and charged particles everywhere else in the universe And this force is much much greater than the force of gravity In fact the magnitude of electromagnetism is 10 to the 36 times greater than the magnitude of gravity So why isnt electromagnetism the most dominant force in the universe The reason is because on large scales electric charges of large objects tend to cancel each other out Large objects tend to be neutral So since a charged particle can only affect other charged particles this force is mostly nonexistent at large scales If large things were not electrically neutral this force would completely dominate our universe But electromagnetism still has a big influence on our world It is responsible for the nature of light and it is the main force responsible for all the biochemistry taking place in our bodies and the rest of Earth Its the basis of all chemistry So now you have to ask if electromagnetism is so strong then what keeps multiple protons each of which are positively charged bound in the nucleus of atoms According to Coulombs law if you do the calculations the two protons of a helium atom experience a force equal to about 20 pounds For something as small as atoms this is a huge force They should repel each other and fly apart instantly The reason that protons dont fly apart is because they are kept glued together with a force that is even stronger than electromagnetism 100 times stronger And this force is creatively called the strong nuclear force It is the strongest force in the universe However it extends only as far as the width of a proton Remarkably it is very small or nonexistent beyond this length This force has been described as velcro When two protons are really close the force keeps them strongly bound together But when they are further apart in the width of a proton it is about nonexistent This force is not simply the opposite of electromagnetism though because it is also responsible for holding electrically neutral neutrons in the center of atoms as well Even though this is a force we cant directly experience the world has experienced its effect How Because you see the release of this force is the energy behind nuclear bombs The fission and fusion of atoms releases huge amounts of binding energy from the nucleus of atoms which results from the strong force The binding energy of this force is in fact responsible for most of the mass of any object not the Higgs field as you might have thought And when this binding energy is released the mass of the atom is converted to energy in nuclear reactions Then we get to the weak force This is responsible for a type of radiation called beta radiation which is the emission of electrons or its antimatter equivalent positrons One of the most important processes in nature is the beta decay of a neutron This happens for example when a neutron decays into a proton an electron and an antineutrino If this kind of decay had not occurred then the universe would have been awash in a sea of neutrons and no atoms would have ever formed and we would not have had life This process is also important in making larger atoms stable because a similar decay called beta plus decay occurs when a proton is converted into a neutron a positron and an electron neutrino It results in positron emissions and this process allows for nuclear stability Like the strong force this force is also only effective at really small scales But the range is even shorter than the strong force Its effective length is only about one thousandth the diameter of a proton Now Ive tried to give you an overall perspective on the four fundamental forces But if youre like me you probably have a few questions First you might ask how exactly does a force between particles work What is the underlying mechanism What causes an attraction or repulsion And why does electromagnetism and gravity have an infinite range but the strong and weak force have such a small range The answer to these questions are closely related and they get into some of the most cutting edge and complex science involving quantum mechanics and particle physics And this will be the subject of my next video So stay tuned You wont want to miss it In the meantime

            "Reference summary for training sample 493: In this video Im going to share with you five tips that I use to get the most out of the hybrid classroom Welcome back to my channel Charlies Lessons and thank you for coming back to watch another video In this video were looking at hybrid learning And when I say hybrid learning what I mean is that we have two groups of students One group is facetoface or in person and the other group is online The teacher is with the facetoface students providing instruction to both the online students and the facetoface students Now hybrid learning is the result of the current COVID pandemic but this is not the first time that teachers around the world have had to deal with a pandemic and have students learning remotely If we go back to Chicago in 1937 during a polio outbreak students were sent home and received their classes via the radio Can you imagine your students learning via the radio You want to come in with me and meet some of my dog friends You just turn the page every time I whistle like a fella whistling for his dog Mum the radio stopped working Shall I call the teacher Okay Ill call the teacher now Mum why is everything in this house so old So just be thankful for the technology you do have at your disposal that allows you to see hear and interact with your students I think its important to let you know what hybrid learning looks like for me in my school because every teacher has a slightly different setup In my classroom we connect the online students to the facetoface classroom via a Zoom call We have a wideangle camera that sits just on top of the monitor that captures the teacher and the rest of the students that are facetoface We also have two microphones one connected up to the teacher and one mobile microphone that the teacher can move around the classroom to capture what any student is saying So lets get started with the five tips and ideas I have for the hybrid classroom Now I must say that these ideas require that your students both online and facetoface have access to a mobile device a tablet or a computer This is because in a hybrid classroom its important to create a space where the students can interact given that the students are not physically in the same place My first piece of advice is to make sure that you balance your attention as a teacher between the students online and the students in person When you start teaching hybrid the tendency is to pay more attention to the students that you have in front of you physically than the students that you have online And obviously this can be a disadvantage for those students who are studying online who being online and being remote already feel removed from the classroom So you need to make that extra effort to make sure that you attend to their needs and you interact with them as much as possible Tip number two is to make sure that you spend time with your students introducing how to use new tools and platforms before you start using them So if you have students facetoface one week and online the next make sure you spend that time with them facetoface to go through a tutorial on how to use any new tools that youd like to introduce as a result of your new hybrid classroom If any of the next three ideas Im going to show you are new to you then try to find some time with your students facetoface to go through a stepbystep tutorial on how to use these in the classroom Tip number three is using a platform called Nearpod Now if youve never heard of Nearpod before then make sure you go and watch my full tutorial in which I explain how to use it from scratch right here The reason why Nearpod is perfect for the hybrid classroom is that it is a platform that brings in the facetoface students and online students and moves them together at the same pace with the teacher controlling how quickly they go The Nearpod lesson library has a wealth of content you can use with your students My recommendation has to be the VR field trips These are hands down the most enjoyable experience for my students With the VR field trips you can make trips to various cities around the world that the students probably havent been to And by doing this you can notice describe or even compare what the students see in various different cities Tip number four is a website called whiteboardfi And the reason I love using this in my hybrid classroom is that it gives me an opportunity as the teacher to monitor directly what all the students are doing in the class With whiteboardfi you can share a link with your students and they can access a whiteboard that is also shared with you As the teacher you can see what all the students are doing on each individual whiteboard So with younger learners I often do activities like drawing and spelling So for example with drawing I might call out a vocabulary item and the students have to draw correctly what I said With spelling I might also call out a similar vocabulary item but ask the students to spell their answer With perhaps higher level students we might be doing a task in the book or I might ask an open question and Ill ask the students to write their answer in their whiteboard Theres also an option to push my whiteboard as the teacher so that the other students can see it This is perfect for instruction giving This way I can type out some instructions Id like the students all to see And when I finish writing up my instructions all I do is press the push button and in all the students both online and face to face can see this Tip number five is using a website called classkickcom Now like with Nearpod and whiteboardfi the reason I use Class Kick with my hybrid classroom is that I can connect the online students with the face to face students to work and collaborate in the same space Class Kick works by first setting up a roster for your class so you add all the students names to the roster You then can create an assignment The students are given a class code or link and the students enter the assignment as their name and the teacher can see all the students working through the same task together While working on a task students at any time can raise a hand if they need help or support by the teacher The teacher sees this from the main screen and can then click on the slide or part of the activity the student is currently on This way the teacher and the student are seeing the same task together and the teacher can provide help and assistance with the problem the student has The great thing about Class Kick is students can enter in information via text drawing but also links to websites taking photos and recording audio With the students ability to record audio this makes it perfect for the English language classroom So let me show you some of the ways Ive been using Class Kick with my class The first way Ive been using Class Kick with my class is really simple Once Ive created my roster for my class I go to assignments click on the plus sign at the top and create a new assignment Ive created three slides here and all I want to do is use a PDF from our classwork and have our students work through it So I go to the first slide click background click on import background and import a PDF of the activity Id like to use Now Im going to divide this activity into various parts So I just select the first 12 questions and click next Now this has been uploaded to the slide I want to make it interactive for the students So I select add fill in the blank Im then going to complete all of these For slide two I select the next section of the activity and I continue this until Ive got the whole activity separated into parts for my students to complete Once all the students have logged in I can follow their progress here The second idea for younger learners is to use the draw function and ask the students to draw vocabulary that youre learning So for example and I can add an instruction for slide two and slide three From the teacher view I can click on a slide and leave a positive comment And this will appear on the student slide Idea number three is to use the record audio function to practice pronunciation with your students In this example were looking at an activity for younger learners But what Id have them do is I would upload these flashcards onto one slide and ask the students to record themselves pronouncing the words correct I could then go and listen to their recording and add my own recording so the students could listen if they made any mistakes With older learners I was looking at word stress and it was the same idea I would give them a background like this I would ask them to add an audio and I would listen to that as a teacher and record a second audio myself if I felt there were mistakes in the pronunciation or in this case the word stress The final idea I want to share with you is to use the add link option just here and include an article that youd like your students to read and you can set them comprehension questions So for example lets include an article about Disneyland reopening in California and I set them a comprehension question for example and I would add a fill in the blank option below the question Here the student reads the article and answers the comprehension question Well I hope you find this video helpful If youre teaching hybrid at the moment please share this video with any teacher friends that you have you feel could use some help and ideas Ill see you next time\n",
            "Reference summary for training sample 985: Quantum mechanics is one of the most successful theories in all of science Using its mathematical equations scientists can accurately predict how tiny particles like photons of light and electrons and electrical currents behave It can be used to explain everything from the atomic structure of the elements to the shapes of molecules to the cosmic structure of the universe But amid all its useful equations and accurate predictions a troubling question remains Although quantum mechanics clearly works what does it mean What is it telling us about the true nature of reality The way the universe actually is The rules at the level of atoms and subatomic particles seem to be different from the ones we are used to in our everyday experience They seem weird For example particles appear to be fuzzy and spread out They seem to be in two places at once or two different states at once or affect each other instantly over any distance But is this really what quantum mechanics says All these claims are no more than clumsy attempts to interpret the theory using everyday language But everyday language wasnt designed for the quantum world It was designed for the macro world of classical physics which is what we observe at human scales Here objects can be seen and touched and watched as they follow predictable paths in space at precise speeds that we can measure Surprisingly for such a wellestablished and accurate theory as quantum mechanics there is still no consensus on what it really means Physicists differ in what they think quantum theory tells us about the world Some think its every bit as concrete and definite as our classical world Some see a multiverse where all possibilities exist For others quantum mechanics sets the ultimate limit of how much we can really know about reality If you hear an expert insist that they know what it means be cautious In this video Ill tell you why its so hard to be sure of the answer but also what we can say for sure about it Thats coming up right now Many things inspired me to make this video but one documentary which really influenced me is what I watched on Magellan TV todays sponsor Its called Einsteins Nightmare hosted by one of my favorite educators Jim AlKhalili Jim takes us on a journey starting with Einsteins dislike for the idea that nature could be fundamentally probabilistic and shows how we came to the conclusion that it must be this way This is what we call a natural phenomenon Its a phenomenon that is not just a phenomenon but a natural phenomenon This is only one of thousands of fascinating documentaries on Magellan TV Its a new kind of documentary service created by the filmmakers themselves who bring you the highest quality content Featured topics include science history travel and technology Magellan has a special offer right now for Arvin Ashfiers If you click the link in the description youll get a free one month trial Its totally worth giving it a try I so be sure to click the link in the description If we want to understand quantum mechanics we have to start with the math because thats where the heart of the theory lies But dont worry Im not going to derive any equations just describe them Arguably the most important quantum equation was figured out in the mid1920s by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger He was picking up on the suggestion of French scientist Louis de Broglie that maybe quantum particles can behave like waves Schrödinger came up with an equation to describe this waviness and it looked a lot like the equation scientists had used to describe ordinary waves like those in water This equation may look complicated but at its heart is just an equation describing energy Kinetic energy plus potential energy equals total energy It includes a mathematical function called the wave function which encapsulates all that can be known about a quantum object like an electron or atom or even a molecule The objects wave function usually written as the Greek symbol psi has a particular value at all points in space And this value depends on the that the quantum object is in For a single quantum particle for example in a square box the wave function of the lowest energy state has a single peak in the middle If you know the wave function Schrödingers equation lets you figure out for example where you will find the particle in space or how fast it is traveling or how much energy it has But what is the wave function Thats the key question we need to answer to understand what quantum mechanics is telling us about the world In some ways pretty much all the arguments that still rage about this question boils down to disagreements about what a wave function really is If we plot out a typical wave function for a particle it looks a bit like a wave But a wave of what For example a water wave is made of water molecules But a wave function for a quantum object isnt really made of any substance other than the information about the object The amplitude of a water wave is simply the height of the wave The amplitude of a wave function is simply its value at any point In addition the amplitude of a quantum wave function is generally a complex number which means that it contains some term that is an imaginary number which is the square root of a negative number Its not a whole number like 1 2 3 and so on What does an imaginary number mean Well its not a physically meaningful quantity but they are useful in simplifying the mathematics of anything that oscillates But when we square an imaginary number we get a real number So the square of a wave function the value of psi squared becomes a real number This has no imaginary component so it can correspond to the value of some real measurable quantity At first Schrodinger himself thought that the value of psi squared at any point in space tells us what the density of the quantum object like an electron is at that point In other words maybe the particle really is smeared out almost like a cloud of gas with different densities in different places But he was wrong German physicist Max Born said that the square of the wave function isnt the density of the particle instead its the probability It tells us the probability that well find the particle at that point in space if we look If we add up psi squared for every point in space it will equal one Meaning that if we look everywhere we are bound to find the particle somewhere Borns rule is at the heart of why quantum mechanics is such a peculiar theory and why its so hard to say what it means Compared to what we find in classical physics the equivalent of Schrodingers equation is an equation of motion like the one that describes the path of a basketball We can use Newtons laws of motion to write down a mathematical expression for its trajectory and use it to calculate exactly where the ball will be at each moment in time There are no probabilities No ambiguity We can say for sure that if we look at one particular point in space at a particular time well find the ball there If we look elsewhere in space at that moment we know that we wont find the ball there But a wave function says that for a quantum object we might find the object at many different places in space at any given instant with various probabilities We can never be sure which of these it will be in And in fact if we can measure several different particles with the same wave function in successive experiments we are likely to find it at different places each time The wave function itself can change over time rising and falling like an ordinary wave But this simply changes the probabilities of finding the particle at different places for each instant As the physicist Roland Onnes has put it the wave function is the fuel of a machine that manufactures probabilities Now heres whats particularly perplexing You might think that the wave function tells us where the particle probably is at any point in time But it doesnt tell us that It tells us as I said earlier only the chance of finding it there if we look What if we dont look Well then all we have to go by is the wave function itself which says nothing about where the particle is It only lets us figure out the probabilities of where wed find it if we looked there or made a measurement of some sort there Its often said that the wave function implies that until we look the particle is everywhere or at least its smeared out But thats not really right because Borns rule doesnt mean that Borns rule is only about the probabilities of the outcomes of measurements This mathematical machinery tells us not what the quantum world is like but only what well see if we measure it So the idea that before we measure it the particle is everywhere is not quite correct It doesnt tell us what is It only tells us what we might expect if we look But this also doesnt mean that nothing exists until we look A quantum world exists whether we look at it or not Its just very hard to know exactly what we can say about it before we look beyond what its wave function is And thats whats so peculiar about quantum mechanics Because unlike most other scientific theories it doesnt give us a clue about whats really happening but what we might experience when we measure things It says nothing obvious about what quantum reality itself is like All we can do is try to find the best story to tell about whats really happening Now one story from a famous experiment really does look as though quantum particles can be smeared out This is the famous double slit experiment Richard Feynman called this the central mystery of quantum mechanics The setup of this experiment is something like this We fire photons or electrons or any quantum object one at a time towards two closely spaced slits and then place a fluorescent screen on the other side What we see is a pointlike single flash when the electron hits it after going through the slits This appears normal and nothing special However if we keep firing multiple thousands of electrons one at a time we begin to see an interference pattern This may at first appear to be mysterious How could single electrons fired one at a time interfere when no two electrons had the opportunity to interact with each other But this really shouldnt be such a surprise because it is precisely what quantum mechanics predicts It predicts that we should see an interference pattern because individual electrons are like waves Its very much like a water wave If we sent a water wave through the slits we would see an interference pattern on the other side Similarly individual electrons would behave like a wave that passes through both slits too and this wave would split and emerge from each slit to interfere with each other You might say OK then why dont we see a wave interference pattern on the fluorescent screen when we send just one electron through the slits The reason is because the particle behaves like a wave as long as we dont measure it But the fluorescent screen acts like a measuring device When we measure it at the screen it takes a particlelike position So when electrons hit the screen they are no longer in superposition They lose their quantumness They take on a pointlike appearance because they are measured The wave becomes localized to a fuzzy point The interference pattern is not visible when an individual electron is measured by the screen but if we measure thousands of individual electrons one at a time the interference pattern emerges This happens because more electrons show up on parts of the screen where the probability amplitude is higher due to constructive interference of the wave And they dont show up where the probability amplitude has destructive interference In other words because the Schrodinger equation only gives us probabilities we have to make many repeated measurements of these individual electrons to see if what we measure fits those probabilities And it always does So the double slit experiment should not be a mystery It shows us exactly what quantum mechanics predicts that individual particles have wavelike behavior which can be seen in the collective pattern created by shooting lots of particles through the double slit and measure it Had we not gotten this result we would have to rethink quantum mechanics So again what really is the wave function Is it just math that lets us predict what well see in a quantum experiment Or is it a real physical object like an ocean wave that tells us about the underlying reality that causes those observations Some theories attempt to define the collapse as a real physical process To give you a fuller perspective I invited fellow YouTuber and friend Sabina Hassenfelder to tell you about these as well as her favorite theory Hi Arvind I have one thing to add Quantum mechanics may seem weird to us because its not actually the right theory This is why some physicists have tried to improve quantum mechanics by turning the collapse of the wave function into a physical process This removes the ambiguity about how to interpret the wave function Its a real thing and it really collapses There are three major approaches to this at the moment The probably best known one is Penroses gravitationally induced collapse The idea is that a superposition of quantum particles should also come with a superposition of quantum spacetimes And those Penrose says dont exist long so the wave function collapses Another idea is called spontaneous collapse and the best known example is the GRW model In this model the wave function stochastically collapses a little bit every now and then until its entirely localized And then there is superdeterminism Superdeterministic models are also collapse models but they are not stochastic Instead the apparent randomness of quantum measurements is explained by hidden variables Its not much of a secret that personally I think superdeterminism is correct Thanks for letting me join Thank you Sabina and be sure to check out her channel at the link in the description And while youre there subscribe for some great physics content The problem is we cant really see the wave function of a single particle because when we observe the particle like when the electron hits the screen in the double slit experiment its spread out wave function seems to collapse to a single sharp spike where we find the particle A standard quantum theory with its Schrodinger equation and smooth wave functions doesnt actually provide any description of the measurement process We dont really know why or how the collapse of the wave function happens We have to add in the collapse to the theory in a makeshift sort of way Its even been suggested that our own conscious awareness of the measurement result somehow alters the wave function Theres not really any good reason to think thats true though The collapse happens whether we are looking at it or not How it happens and what causes it to happen is called the measurement problem and its one of the biggest causes of arguments about what quantum mechanics means Some researchers say that we cant deduce much about that underlying reality If all quantum mechanics gives us is probabilities about measurements we just have to accept that thats all we can know And who really cares about a question that seems more philosophical than physical as long as the theory correctly predicts the outcomes of experiments The extreme version of this was summed up by physicist David Mermin in the expression shut up and calculate And its a view that some quantum physicists take today They dont want to bother about questions that lie beyond what we can measure and observe because that doesnt seem like science They just use the theory to calculate what their molecules or devices will do Others go to the opposite extreme They say that at the most fundamental level reality really is a wave function This view is commonly shared by scientists and philosophers who believe in the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics often called the Everettian view because it was first proposed by the physicist Hugh Everett in the 1950s In this view the entire universe is a gigantic wave function and we can probe little bits of this wave function with our experiments Because a quantum wave function encodes many different possible outcomes all those places in space for example that we might observe a particle to be in Everettians say that all of these are equally real We only observe one outcome but the measurement also elicits all the other possible outcomes too in different worlds or universes So while you might measure an electron to be in one location in this world there are other worlds where you measure it in a different spot We experience just one because the measurement itself causes the universal wave function to split into separate universes where a copy of you measures something else These worlds are isolated from each other Many worlds is seen by many who are growing in number as the conservative option the one that adds the least to the bare math of quantum mechanics The fact that there are different interpretations of what might really be happening is unusual for a scientific theory Its a frustration that there doesnt appear to be a good way to test which interpretation is correct Quantum mechanics seems to say that reality works in certain mathematically predictable ways but we can never see it working that way Because when we try to see it by taking a measurement it seems to work a different way And thats what many physicists find so disturbing That quantum mechanics doesnt appear to show that there is a set reality out there independent of how we choose to look at it That seems to fly in the face of all that weve come to believe about science that it can tell us about how reality really is regardless of what we believe But this doesnt mean that an objective reality doesnt exist Quantum mechanics gives us a theory that makes our measurements predictable and it works the same for everyone so its repeatable Predictability and repeatability are the hallmarks of an objective reality But it appears we are not completely independent of this reality since we are also part of the universe that quantum theory describes Perhaps quantum mechanics is simply the kind of theory we need to understand a universe of that kind And if you enjoyed this video give us a like and subscribe for a

            "Reference summary for training sample 65: This is a cattail heart and we are foraging essentially for our lives Can changing the way we eat save the planet Today we are going to be trying to forage for our calories We cooking tonight Mom Create food without soil Youre going to help us grow things we love you And essentially why not become farmers Thats too smart I really have to think about how to get protein Oh Theres a bit of sandy texture I cant believe we broke being vegetarian for this Were feeling the heat and its not just our sexy good looks Its climate change Oh And through our YouTube channel Aesop Science we detail some of the biggest issues were facing But thats no longer enough We know how to talk the talk now we have to walk the walk And theres no time to waste Sure were going to go to the farm So were taking our passion for the environment and scientific knowhow out of the classroom and into the country We are going off the grid One by one well shut off our basic necessities Production has officially turned off our power Im freaking out Allowing us to experiment with everything from new technology Youre literally going to use P to power your phone Yes To traditional technology God its like the most satisfying thing Ive ever seen in my life To find solutions that promote sustainability Oh my gosh And with help from our team we will use science For a little selfreliance Yes Callux See you city Because this is Shut It Off Aesop Ive never lived on a farm have you No are you kidding Everything about my personality is very ongrid So I am nervous about what we are about to do Hey were turning onto a side road Oh my God I feel crazy Ooh were here Ernie Lets go see Oh my God Were at the farm Come on Oh my God Its like were at camp Yes thats exactly it Ooh Ernie its your new home Its nice Oh my God Its cute Is it too rustic Oh and outdoor kitchen Oh there is a spider in there This is what Mitch was scared of so its going to be a long time here at this little chalet Stop shaving me on camera I am afraid of bugs so for sure every aspect of this experiment is really just going to be suffering for me Oh Oh my God How are you How are you The accommodations are rustic for sure I know theres a lot of work and fear and discomfort to come but for right now Im feeling excited Its so quaint We are no longer little city boys We want all of our knowledge of sustainability and going offgrid to relate to the climate crisis to relate to the bigger picture to relate to our life in a city Today our groceries are officially being shut off So that means were not going to have things that we usually have in our trusty fridge in the cabin but were being left with some staples over here some pasta some oatmeal some things that will make sure that wed somehow survive Weve been curious about where our food comes from how it grows so were going to learn a lot about agriculture and the climate crisis during this experiment Im very nervous I hate being hungry We need to figure out how were going to be subsidizing our calories with the environment around us which is going to be very nerveracking so we need to think of a plan Lets talk about where the energy in our food comes from It all starts with the sun Green plants containing chlorophyll absorb light energy from the sun and then using water and carbon dioxide create glucose which the plant uses for energy to grow When you eat that plant or eat an animal that eats that plant you consume calories that were once light energy from the sun released through nuclear fusion 150 million kilometers away that are now stored in chemical bonds in the fats proteins and carbs we eat Chemist Wilbur Atwater calculated their approximate caloric content to be four calories per gram of protein and carbs and nine calories for fat These figures give us the caloric estimates we see on modern food packaging The average adult male eats around 2500 calories per day but weve been tracking ourselves with an app and we only eat around 1800 calories per day So we want to get as many of those calories from alternative sources and I want to share my idea first Is that okay Yes yours is always so cool So we have a classic fish tank and of course in that fish tank we got a little fishies Oh my gosh theyre raving fish Where the heck did you get these And these fish basically we feed them and they poop out waste Were going to use bacteria that grow on all these rocks at the bottom to turn that waste into a usable energy source for our plants Wow so its like a little mini farm This is called aquaponics and if all goes to plan well be able to grow fresh food without using any soil Oh my God youre so extra Demo for yall thought I got a basket Did you weave it I did not even weave it Ive found an indigenous chef named Sean Adler whos going to help us forage from around our cabin and teach us about the wild flowers that are there and how we can prepare them and eat them and its good to have a guide because you can die So this is Sean Adler who is our expert forager We are Canadians foraging for the first time and think its very important that we acknowledge were on indigenous land specifically the treaty land and territory of Mississaugas of the New Credit Thats important for us to remember as we forage off of the land Lets do it I think this looks like a great place to start foraging Okay Its a nice mixed bush Weve got some pasture This is like a supermarket over here basically Oh my God a supermarket I can get into that Oh I dont know if I have the agility for this I was really trying to show off on that one This is prime From here I can see watercress like all of this Wait so whats watercress Watercress is a great green Try that Just eat it Just eat it Oh my God Yep itll be like a little bit bitter but amazing source of vitamins Thats so good Watercress is number one on the CDCs list of fruits and veg for nutrient density packed with vitamin A C and K Wow Oh my Lord This is basically the best survival food anywhere around Thats the pollen of a cattail At this time of year what you really want is the heart Steam that and its delicious Cattails are a good source of fiber and minerals like manganese Im getting hungry for the salad after all this walking Whats the next sort of thing So the next one I think we should grab for our salad is jewelweed Jewelweed Jewelweed Its right around here Can you find it This Dun dun dun Oh my God its just the first thing I saw that I hadnt seen before When you put water on it the little bit of water that actually does stick it looks like a jewel Oh my gosh Its a really cool plant Jewelweed is not just for delicious salads its juice can treat poison ivy and athletes foot Is there any sort of thought about over foraging Like should we be leaving behind something Yes you dont want to pull the roots And watercress like a lot of herbs when you pinch them it encourages the outer growth So were actually promoting this to branch out Ooh purple pretty flowers here Yeah what about that I dont think this is a good idea This here will make you dead What This has a very apt name This is Deadly Night Shade If we eat these berries we would die It like shuts down your liver and all sorts of organs so this is not edible Okay so this is very real what we are doing Very real Thats insane The forage was a success but we are going to need more calories and protein Since were on a working farm neither of those things are very far away So youre telling me that you want to work so that you can eat Yes meat eggs meat eggs meat protein So thats called farming Oh firefighters Youre like you need to do something to get that Yeah So I actually have to move this chicken coop today and the chickens in the coop So if I go get my tractor can you guys just round up all these chickens and get them in the coop Like we physically get them in there Yes So why are we moving this mobile chicken coop somewhere Why do we even have to do this I am going to use these chickens to fertilize my soil and help scratch open the turf Amazing So this ones done Thats right Okay so theyre functional chickens You should be done by the time I get back with my tractor Okay well see Good luck I know Mitch and Greg are both city boys so I foresee this being an interesting exercise Here chicken chicken Okay they run That seems not catchable It should not take more than 20 minutes Oh jeez Okay weve got this one Oh buddy Oh I didnt even know they could do that Ow Wolfgangs farm uses mobile chicken coops which are regularly moved to new patches of land This one does not want to be caught The chickens scratch and dig the soil when they forage for food which spreads and mixes our soil layers in a very nondestructive way It feels like a really just weird video game Thats too smart One single chicken can till 45 square meters of soil in about four weeks at which point the soil should be ready for crop planting Oh I got one Its okay Mitch Okay Im going to be calm to not stress it out Okay there you go Okay Oh theres poo on my hand now Theres literally poo on my hands All I have is poo on my hand and I havent even caught one chicken Chicken poop has the highest nitrogen phosphorus and potassium content of all animal manure It adds organic matter and helpful bacteria that soil needs to break down plant matter All this increases the health of the soil We just want to put you with your friends Got it Another one Oh my gosh It was devastating for me I really felt like I was going to be good at it Weve got one left Here comes Wolf with the tractor I got her Oh my gosh Im so sorry I left you Are you okay Now gently flip it over Its calm Its calm Okay Oh there you go We did it Did you We just finished You just finished now Yes I feel like you could probably do what we did in three minutes I think its really great that Mitch and Greg are doing this I love the opportunity to bring hard science to something that the average person does not associate with hard science which is agriculture Oh One dozen eggs Thank you so much As promised theres a little bit of poo on them but thats normal Theres poo on my hands Yeah theres literally poo all over us How many farms are doing this versus those large tilling processes Its increasingly popular Agriculture is bad for the planet Full stop Its not what the planet wants Its not whats healthy as for the soil Soil is a living breathing ecosystem with a complex structure of plants roots and microorganisms working together Tilling disrupts that system It breaks up the structure and makes it more vulnerable to being washed away It removes the live roots that are the microbes food It opens up channels that can flood with water then prevents the microbes from getting enough air This not only damages the soil quality but also makes it release chemicals into the waterways and carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere The global population is expected to increase by almost two billion in the next 30 years And over a third of the worlds farmable land is currently being lost to pollution and erosion By the way soil erosion is happening at a rate 100 times greater than soil formation Its clear we have a huge problem We have to think more about how we get our food Im curious as a farmer what advice you have thinking of climate change and the global crisis like how we can shop and think about our food Happy animals make for a happy microecology make for happy soil make for a happy environment We are actively helping to sink some of the carbon in the atmosphere back into the soil When we do that we will starve if we keep just like taking everything we can without putting some back So its as simple as that Well thank you so much Youve taught us so much The last question is are we allowed to let our new best friends out of the coop now It would be weird if we didnt after that conversation Look you got new legs Its satisfying to move a chicken coop and then fertilize new soil and feel like youre helping out with like the biosphere and creating a carbon sink on this farm That feels good With the help of experts Arvind and Gayatri were ready to get our system up and running While our build is small aquaponic systems have a huge global potential Because they rely on water instead of soil to grow crops theyre an effective way of growing food in areas of the world with little to no farmable land Time to fill her up Lets go over this aquaponic cycle just so I can get into my brain Sure We start over with three inputs to the fish tank Thats water oxygen and fish feed Fish consume the feed produce our magic nutrients the microbe families in our filters help break down the fish waste to nitrates and make it readily available for the plants to consume And then the demineralized water goes back into the fish tank and its one happy system A nice big cycle that just repeats over and over Over and over again yes Plants need nitrogen to make the amino acids that are their building blocks Without it they cant grow and theyll lose their green color Although they cant absorb nitrogen from the air their roots can suck up nitrate compounds Weve got our air bubbles going through both tanks Everythings circulating in the system So were going to take our lettuce board place it on top and then tomorrow our fishies come and the whole thing is complete Its time to turn the days harvest into a tasty lunch of fried cattails and salad Okay lets get started chef Well get our cattail hearts cooking Garlic mustard Ill chop it up and then Ill get you to grind it in our mortar Im good at smashing stuff So yeah To all my high school bullies That looks great Im going to make a vinaigrette Were cooking tonight mom Whats going on here Oh its just time for me to toss the salad Oh my gosh Okay whats going on So weve made a garlic mustard pesto fire roasted cattail hearts with our water cress and jewel weed salad Need some color though Oh my God Okay this is the thing Nostertium edible flowers Oh perfect That is great You guys now we can eat Now we can eat Oh yeah It is so fresh Its so delicious I cant get over the cattails Ive never even really tasted anything like it Good job you guys Like I did not expect to come down to like a gourmet meal So good Thank you so much Youve honestly changed my perspective on a lot of things today And without you I think we might have died by eating that nightshade Thank you for saving our lives Youre welcome Good luck guys Should we get a bowl for Ernie Yeah Just daddy and I So hungry and its going to be dark soon Were just going to simply have pasta and go to bed Oh my God That could have been it That could have been it We wanted al dente It might still be really hard well see Very al dente Oh yeah its crunchy It needs more time Were ready to add the fish to our system Although there are many species of fish used in aquaponics were using tilapia because theyre extremely hardy and can survive a wide range of pH and temperatures This is so fun Youre going to help us grow things Youre so great We love you Animals and plants are supposed to live together feeding one another But a lot of the time we break that cycle and have to artificially support each other So were going to have to do that But a lot of the time we break that cycle and have to artificially supply those nutrients Here were building a whole ecosystem making use of what nature already does Our very first aquaponic system is built and complete Wow Now we just wait for our lettuce to grow If our system is working properly we should see significant growth within a few weeks and it will be ready to pick in 28 days While our staples are helping to sustain us we are still hungry and I think I know why Its time to check how close we are to our daily goal of 1800 calories Im calculating how many calories I have foraged and Im nervous Now a calorie is the amount of energy that it takes to increase one milliliter of water by one degree Celsius That is one calorie with a lower KC But the food calories that were all used to reading on packaging is an upper KC calorie which is a thousand of these Its more energy Our foraged greens are a great source of vitamins and minerals but they arent very caloriedense Foods that contain fats and protein have a higher caloric density meaning you get a lot more calories from a smaller portion of food Everything that is edible on this table only adds up to 1179 calories Thats not nearly enough calories I definitely expended more energy getting this than I will be from eating it so I really have to think about how to get protein Proteins are made up of amino acids strung together in chains At its core an amino acid molecule looks like this an amino group of nitrogen and two hydrogen connected to a carboxyl group of carbon oxygen and hydrogen bonded to a side chain The side chain or R group is what makes each amino acid different Here is a bunch and you can think of them all as an alphabet of letters that our body strings together to create proteins These proteins keep you alive so your body needs amino acids to build the chains that make up your proteins Your body can make most amino acids but those it cannot are called essential amino acids and ultimately you need to eat protein with these essential amino acids in order to live If you do not your body takes amino acids from your muscles and you dont want that Thats why lots of gym bros always eat so much protein so their muscles get bigger Since essential amino acids are vital for survival its time to head back into the woods and forage for some protein Follow the birds Part of the challenge is this season A lot of highcalorie highprotein foods like nuts and seeds are only available in the fall here in Ontario So this is an immature black walnut Theyre going to grow about three or four times that size You can see the nut inside hasnt formed yet Sean had shown us some walnuts but they were still too early to eat so Ill need to get creative Earthworms are 60 to 70 protein so theyre the way that we are going to be getting protein from foraging and they have essential amino acids lysine and methionine They actually have more per gram essential amino acids than meat and fish They also have vitamin B12 and omega3 fatty acids They also have lots of calcium more than even cheese per gram Oh Oh Here she goes This is hell This is what our tenth salad I dont know Weve had a lot of a salad Theres hardly any protein in this So far I feel like we havent like got a whole system figured out for how we actually feed ourselves You promised you were working on something for like more sustenance more protein right Oh youre going to love it Mitch Just you wait Is it going to be bad Sorry I almost just threw up in my mouth Oh Thats a little foreshadowing OK maybe Ill stick with the salad I hate it I hate it I hate it I hate it I hate it Oh Im sorry While earthworms are edible they must be boiled to remove any bacteria like E coli from their digestive tract to before you can eat them Were going to need a lot of sauce I was picturing you know like a meaty red but weve ended up with a beigey bluegreen Hahaha Great OK here we go Oh theres a lot of dirt Oh my God Never show this to Mitch Im not even kidding Hes going to murder me when he watches this No I just squirted OK A little salt oatmeal eggs and herbs quickly transforms the mushy worms into something seemingly palatable Have you ever been more appetised in your life It actually smells good It actually smells good Im not just saying that I know I did almost just ralph all over the place about 20 times but that is a bit of a gorgeous meatball OK The whole experience of making the earthworm meatballs is a blur to me of adrenaline and fear and I was just boiling earthworms alive which made me feel bad but then I felt bad that I didnt care because I was eating them I felt bad that I didnt care because they were worms Our aquaponic system has been up and running for a bit now but we want to check in on the progress to make sure its working Tada Our test is done and we can see that the lettuce are starting to grow Theres no soil Thats so great Yeah This is a great sort of smallscale diorama but could a fish farm do this 100 Some of them are already starting to do it So you have the fish making the nutrients and instead of dealing with that waste and putting it into lakes and oceans you can actually use it to create more food This is a great alternative for places that are in food deserts that dont have the ability with rich soil to grow agriculture in the same way Yeah Do we want to do a little taste test Yeah for sure OK Cheers Cheers I was a little concerned that it might taste like fish and it doesnt at all taste like lettuce Oh my God imagine tilapia That tastes really good Tastes like lettuce Our aquaponic setup is working but because the lettuce hasnt grown enough for us to eat were leaving the system on the farm where they can use it to grow crops in the future Lots of oil Something were going to hope is going to help Oh the sizzle Ooh I never plan to eat earthworms As a vegetarian I have ample amounts of peanuts on my hand to get my protein some quinoa Its looking like a meatball This is exciting It just looks like theres a little bit of like intestines and plastic tubes spilling out of one of them But other than that it looks pretty good Hola Micho Welcome to my Italian restaurant Have a seat Its beautiful Its very cute Im just like where are they Michos going to have to eat this because its on camera but I am very much worried for him I think he might hate it I think I might hate it I am nervous This whole meal 198 calories have been forged Its the most calories weve got thanks to these earthworm meatballs Thats actually a lot for one meal Here you go Enjoy Oh my God Like it actually doesnt look that bad but I just actually feel so sick right now Theres a lot of pressure for me to eat this thing because I did make it myself Im just hoping that we dont get sick Im hoping that we arent eating whats inside the worms which could be feces e coli you name the protozoa it could be there Okay Im going to get some sauce Cheers Okay Going in Its not that bad actually I dont mind it I dont mind it We have a little pasta as a palate cleanser I really dont like when you can kind of sort of see the intestinal looking parts of the worm Wait wheres the Dont look close Matt Keep eating What did you season it with Herbs Salt pepper and oil So is this a romantic meal Bleh This experience made me realize we obviously rely on the current systems to get our food like grocery stores but I want to figure out how we can work together to make these systems less damaging Im thinking about community gardens Im thinking about access to green space parks places where we feel happy and also can maybe forage We also need to acknowledge that our food has a huge impact on the environment A recent study found that just 20 meat and dairy companies emit more greenhouse gases than Germany Britain or France And they receive billions of dollars in funding to do so But while corporations are disproportionately responsible for global emissions our individual choices in what we choose to eat can make a difference When you know where your food comes from when you understand its impact on the environment it can actually change your behaviour And maybe theres a company out there that can figure out how to make earthworms taste good No Theres a bit of sandy texture A bit of dirt It actually doesnt taste bad Every single time Im aware that its a worm then it freaks me out And Im sure the spaghetti aspect doesnt help that Yeah thats true Why do we have to have spaghetti with the earthworm Just like looks more What would pair well with an earthworm Or an earthy mezcal Or like coffee to Kahns Ballad or something Considering this just came from the ground near our cabin its pretty amazing And its high caloric intake Honestly the apocalypse is coming Youre all going to have to eat this soon anyway So whos laughing now\n",
            "Reference summary for training sample 141: These are called Friedman numbers It can be written in a nontrivial way just using the digits itself together with any combination of your usual mathematical signatures plus minus times divide You can even raise things to a power and you can use some combination of brackets if necessary So 25 is a Friedman number Why is 25 a Friedman number Because it can be written in terms of the two digits that make it up as 5 to the power 2 So Ive just used the raising power operator to do that 121 same sort of idea 2 ones form 11 and I raise it to the power 2 and Ive got 121 Immediately Im seeing this could be described as recreational mathematics Its the kind of thing I used to have great fun playing with but actually theres some really neat things you can do with it The brackets youve got to be a little bit careful with Youre not allowed just to simply wrap one number up in a bracket So 125 is 5 to the power of 2 plus 1 So Im just using the brackets there to add the 2 and the 1 and make up 3 so 5 cubed is 125 Well if I wanted to go for 1 say with 4 digits then 9261 is 21 to the power of 9 minus 6 So theres actually 72 of these numbers with 4 or less digits and theres a really nice sort of subset of them 14 of these are known as nice Friedman numbers Well a nice Friedman number is where the order of the digits remains the same So a simple one is 127 127 is made up of minus 1 plus 2 to the power 7 The order of the digits 127 is the same as appears on the right hand side Whereas if I say took 125 the left hand side is 125 but the right hand side is 521 or 512 Is that not nice Not formally nice For many of us we quite enjoy 125 Its got many nice properties But on this occasion its not a nice number not a nice Friedman number anyway So you could do I mean if I want to just get a bit bigger 343 for example is just made up of 3 plus 4 to the power 3 Or I could get a bit bigger and 6455 is made up of 6 to the power 4 minus 5 all times 5 So you get the idea that you can make up various combinations And in fact weve already come across a class of these vampire numbers that weve done videos with So vampire numbers are made up of these where instead of using all the various combinations were just using the multiplication So vampire numbers are an example So 1260 is a vampire number but its also a Friedman number because its 21 times 60 You know you can get a bit bigger So weve got 5 digit numbers of which there are 272 of them by the way 101 92 which is 101 to the power 2 minus 9 And if I went to a 10 digit one 8 3 2 6 1 9 7 5 or 4 whats that equal to 91248 to the power of 5 minus 3 plus 0 times 67 The 0 times 67 together have they just used the 0 there to cheat away Well the notes in here and so its part of it But it does make there is an interesting caveat which we have to I should have mentioned You cant have leading zeros theyre not allowed For example something like 001729 and write that as 1700 plus 29 Im not allowed to have the leading zeros in there in that definition But there is some neat one theres some even more Better than this is It gets better Whats the smallest number the smallest Friedman number that I can make up when Im just repeating the same digit These are called rep digits arent they Rep digits rep digits okay And the smallest is 1 2 3 These are all nines 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 And its made up of 9 plus 9 over 9 to the power of 9 minus 9 over 9 minus 9 over 9 How about ones So now weve got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 And that is equal if Ive got my algebra right 11 minus 1 to the power of 11 minus 1 times 1 divided by 11 minus 1 minus 1 So theyve got the same number on the right hand side Why are you laughing Because its just cool But I havent finished Theres more Theres more How about if I ask the following Theres a set of numbers called your pandigital We have covered pandigital numbers Oh youve done Yeah okay Well you havent done pandigital Friedman numbers I bet Heres one right So a pandigital number is the one that includes all the numbers in any given base So if I say 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Well I can write that as a Friedman number because thats equal to I think I need two brackets 86 plus 2 times 7 to the power of 5 minus 91 all divided by 3 to the power of 4 So thats one pandigital number We can do another one 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Right And this is 8 times 97 plus 6 over 2 to the power of 5 plus 1 again divided by 3 to the power of 4 You might say is it easy to get a nice pandigital number And indeed theyre there but theyre not that easy to get There is one here 2 6 8 4 3 5 1 7 9 And that is equal to remember whats nice about it is the order remains the same The order of the numbers remains the same So its minus 268 plus 4 to the power of 3 times 5 minus 1 to the power of 7 minus 9 And that will give you back your original number It turns out as a number of digits and the number increases the likelihood of it being a Friedman number also increases If there are f of n Friedman numbers less than any given number n then it turns out and I dont know the proof of this I havent been through it that as n increases the ratio of f of n over n tends to 1 In other words the likelihood of finding a number tends to unison So given a distribution of numbers of larger n then you pick a number at random then the likelihood is that its actually a Friedman number So the higher we go in the number line the more dense it becomes with Friedman numbers Yeah I think thats right Numberphile is supported by the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute But while we show you these Friedman numbers in Roman numerals wed also like to thank these viewers who support us on Patreon And if youd like to get involved and maybe even adopt a number on our website just for the fun of it details are in the video description\n",
            "Reference summary for training sample 244: Hi everyone welcome to episode 9 So there are just two pretty simple things that I want to get done in this video The first is to get collisions working for both 3D and 2D mode And the second is to get a texture mapped across here Now just considering 2D mode as you can see wed have to rotate the mesh 270 degrees to get it to actually be visible But now the problem comes in where we try to add 2D colliders to an object thats rotated like this You can see its not very happy So what were going to do instead is were going to keep the map generator object unrotated And we will add the colliders to this object And then well create a separate object for the mesh to go on which we can rotate if were in 2D mode So lets create an empty child and Im going to call this cave mesh And Im going to add a mesh filter and a mesh renderer to here And also just apply the cave material there And on the map generator we can just delete the two mesh components from here since were not having a mesh on this object anymore Lets go into the mesh generator and create a public mesh filter variable for our cave And instead of assigning the cave mesh to this object well assign it to the cave object So now if we just run this oops we need to actually apply that first of course If we run it now we would just need to rotate this 270 degrees Of course in 2D mode we dont actually want the walls to be generated since you cant see them So lets create a public bool and call this is2d And well only call create wall mesh if not is2d All right so just do that So let us start with 3D collisions Essentially what were going to do is were going to add a mesh collider to the walls Just to test it out lets create a plane for our ground Im going to size this up Something like that Call that ground Since Im in play mode its going to delete itself when I go out of play mode so Ill just copy it first and paste it back in Just put it under there Lets also create a C sharp script and were going to create a very simple player controller Just something thats got a rigid body to move it around In the start method we can just assign rigid body r equal to getComponent of type rigidbody We also want a vector3 variable for our velocity In the update method we can just say that velocity is equal to a new vector3 And well get inputs on our horizontal and our vertical axes InputgetAxisForAllvertical Lets normalize this vector3 and multiply it by some speed Because were using a rigid body we want to do all of our actual movement in the fixed update method Well say rigidbodymovePosition And well give it our starting position rigidbodyposition plus the velocity multiplied by timefixedDeltaTime Lets create a little 3D object to be our player Drag it up there Lets create a player material Ill just make this an unlit color something red So its nicely visible just assign it Lets drag our player script on there as well as a rigidbody Im going to make my game window bigger Turn off gizmos So now if we play of course were not colliding with the walls So were going to go into MonoDevelop again into the MeshGenerator script And where were creating the wall mesh right at the end we want to add a MeshCollider to our wall object We can say MeshCollider we can call it our wall collider is equal to wallsgameobjectaddComponent We want to add a MeshCollider And then we can simply say wallCollidersharedMesh is equal to the wall mesh that weve just created Okay that should do the trick So if we press play we can see walls have now got a MeshCollider added to them And our player is constraining to collisions So thats cool Lets set it up for 2D now Im going to call this scene 3D Im going to duplicate it and create a 2D version So lets go into that 2D version and in here Ill say is2D And Im going to take my cave mesh Im going to rotate it 270 degrees Im going to do the same thing with my ground in fact 270 So now if we go into 2D mode press play lets see if this is working Okay I think it is working but we want this ground plane to just move back a bit Okay thats good For our little player guy here Im going to create a 2D version of this player script Ill just call that player2D Open it up Rename it over here as well And instead of a rigid body it will be a rigidbody2D Instead of a vector3 it will be a vector2 Just change all of these things This is a vector2 as well Just remove that And the rest looks good Save Okay no errors Im going to remove the rigidbody and the player script and add instead Oops I should also remove the box collider Add instead a rigidbody2D a box collider2D and my player2D script Okay so now if I press play we should be able to move around here Lets quickly get the camera working Put it there And we need to move it on the Z axis Im just going to turn down the size a bit and position it somewhere so we can see the whole map Okay that looks nice Lets start generating the 2D colliders So going into the mesh generator script Lets see So if not 2D were creating the wall mesh If it is 2D then we want to create some 2D bounds So Im going to say if is2D otherwise create the wall mesh So if it is 2D then generate 2D colliders Okay thats a good name for a method Copy that and lets create the method over here And we want to start off by calculating the mesh outlines because we are going to use that information So just to refresh your memory calculate mesh outlines is going to give us a list of outlines and each outline is made up of a list of integers and those integers refer to the vertices in the vector3 list So what we want to do is we want to go through each of the outlines So for each list of integers which well call outline in the outlines list we want to create a new edge collider 2D for each of them So well say edge collider 2D well call this edge collider is equal to and we want to add the new component to this game object Game objectadd edge collider 2D just like that So to actually set the edge collider well want to use edge colliderpoints which is just an array of vector 2s So lets make a new array of vector 2s which well call our edge points and this is equal to a new array of vector 2s with a length of the number of vertices that make up our outline So outlinecount and then were going to have a for loop 4 into i equals 0 Were going to go through each of the elements in our outline So i less than outlinecount i and then well say edge points i is equal to the vertex in the vertex list So that is vertices and that is with an index of outline i Alright So now having done that we can say edge colliderpoints is equal to edge points Now obviously each time that we generate a new map and calculate these colliders we want to actually start off by removing all of the current colliders So well say edge collider 2D array which well call our current colliders is equal to gameobjectgetComponents So were getting every edge collider 2D thats currently attached to this game object and we want to go through them all 4 into i equals 0 i less than current colliderslength i We want to go through them all and destroy each of them destroy current colliders i Alright So now lets see if this is working Actually it wont be working Ive just realized when we are setting the edge points this is a vector 2 array and these are all vector 3s so we need to convert them to vector 2s but we cant just cast them like so We need to actually take the zaxis and put that as the yaxis So well create a new vector 2 and use the x value from here for the x and the z value for the y Alright lets run this and if we just click on our map generator you can see the edge collider 2D thats been added all around and let me just move my player around You can see hes constraining nicely to collisions and if I click to generate a new map you can see the collider is being destroyed and then added again Cool So the next step is the texturing Okay so lets go to the mesh generator script and Im going to go up to where we created the cave mesh and what we want is an array of vector 2s Each vector 2 will belong to a single vertex and it will basically say the percentage of that vertex on the xaxis in the map and on the yaxis in the map So lets create a new vector 2 array we can call this our UVs its equal to a new vector 2 array and however many vertices we have thats how many vectors we want So just use verticescount as the size and then well have yet another for loop into i equals 0 I want to go through each of the vertices so i less than verticescount i plus plus and we want to get the percent x first of all for the vertex So weve got three bits of information we know the position of the vertex on the xaxis and we can figure out where our map starts on the xaxis and where it ends on the xaxis So we can use mathfinverse alert to figure out the percentage from this So we want to first give it the far left of our map so that will be negative map width divided by 2 So negative map dot get length 0 for the xaxis and we need to multiply that by the square size that we allow to be specified For 2 that will just be the positive version of this oh I didnt divide by 2 that should be in there Alright and then we pass in our actual vertex x value Alright and we want to do the same thing for percent y only here we want to replace this with vertices i dot z Okay then we can quite simply say uvs i is equal to a new vector 2 using percent x and percent y Okay to test this Im just going to drag in a rock texture I found and Im going to apply this to the cave material Alright like that lets run it Okay not exactly working Very good reason for that we havent actually done anything with this uvs array Okay we need to say mesh dot uvs rather uv is equal to our uvs Alright hopefully well have more success this time Okay we do thats brilliant its being applied At the moment it is massive we want to make a way to be able to tile it So what we can do is we can just go in here and create an int tile size or tile amount Set this equal to 10 just to try that out And we can just multiply our percent x by the tile amount Like so And that should make it repeat however many times we set our tile amount to So lets give that another go And that looks pretty cool Okay yeah thats everything for this episode I hope youve enjoyed and see you next episode Cheers\n",

the artificial intelligence program on his computer with a special virus The only person who could do this difficult mission was Agent Jake Vaughn Jake jumped out of a plane with his parachute He landed near Dr Agmas headquarters Jakes partner called him from the operation center and explained his mission She told him to go to the application center and install the virus Jake and his partner were on the way to the operation center The operation center was in the middle of the city The operation center was in the middle of the city Jake entered Agmas center through the underground tunnels And he arrived at the basement He headed to the entrance door and saw the incoming mail He hid inside one of the boxes The man carrying the mail didnt notice him and took him to the warehouse There Jake knocked the man unconscious and wore his clothes Now he looked like a postman So no one realized that he was an agent This way he passed through the document room and got on the elevator Then he reached the application center Jake put on his special glove He unlocked the security by swiping the special glove and entered the application center Inside he turned on the main computer He entered

put a link below to that course so stay tuned all the way to the end and find out what its all about Alright so if you guys arent familiar with Udemy you can go to udemycom They sell some amazing courses and by the way they have a sale going on right now for 1099 You can get any one of their courses So I thought this week Im gonna go ahead and just do some reviews on some of my favorite courses I put a link below with the link to the courses If you go ahead and buy any of the courses through those links I get a couple bucks It helps the channel so thank you if you do that So when I search for Vuejs there is three different courses that come up that are kind of the most popular ones out there on Udemy And thats the Vuejs 2 the complete guide Vuejs 2 the mastering web apps and the ultimate Vuejs 2 developers course Now today Im not gonna go over David Katzs the Vuejs 2 mastering web apps or the ultimate Vuejs 2 developers course Maybe in the future Ill look at that I know Anthony Gore makes some pretty good courses too but I havent taken his So lets take a look at Max Amillians Schwarzmuller And if you dont know Max is also a YouTuber He has a YouTube channel where he does different tutorials and Vuejs and other technologies And he has this course And I think hes one of the first people to create one of these Vuejs 2 courses So lets take a look a little bit about it And you can see here theres 375 lectures Theres already 34000 students involved in it Its 21 hours of content So you definitely get a jampacked amount of content with this course And of course every time you buy a Udemy course you get a lifetime access on it And you know theres tons of good information tons of reviews on it And he says that he knows how to teach splits every detail into smaller parts and makes another video for each part For this reason you dont feel yourself boring while watching videos Because lots of them are 2 minutes not more No matter what metric you look at Vuejs is the shooting star in the world of JavaScript framework So that is true Vuejs is becoming extremely popular So yeah it definitely covers all the basics And were going to go and look at the curriculum or the course content I cant actually show you the videos unfortunately but I can kind of give you an idea of the different course content And I can explain it Ive watched a bunch of it I havent watched every single thing on it but I think I have a pretty good idea of what its all about So definitely directives filters and mixins And then it kind of gives you here are the types of students that love this course Who have some JavaScript experience that have come over from Angular 2 or Reactjs So the requirements basic Java knowledge is required ES6 knowledge is a plus So this is kind of nice He put a little bit more information in there of who can take this course Really if you have a little bit of JavaScript knowledge I think youre probably okay When I watched it he goes over a lot of the concepts Of course if you dont have any JavaScript knowledge you may want to take a look at it below I put a link to Colt Steels course below That might be the complete web developers boot camp That might be a better choice for you if you completely knew If you have some knowledge or youre coming from React or Angular or youve dipped your toe in the JavaScript world and you want to start off with a new framework I mean this was a great one to start with Its really easy to get started up and running in Vuejs And by the way Ill add one more plug My book The Vuejs in Action its in early access You guys can buy it today If you rather watch something or read something I guess it depends on what you like If you want to get kind of really indepth examples on a lot of different things the first seven chapters are out By the time you watch this I might have eight or nine out Well see But you can just have a link below to where you can get the book And by the way you can get the first three chapters two or three chapters for free Actually the first chapter is definitely for free If you click on the link below you can get that free chapter So you can kind of take a look to see if you like it So of course the target audience is for anyone interested in frontend development And I can never pronounce Maximillians I think Maximillian Schmorsmuller Im not very good at it So he actually has a slight accent If youre from the United States I have an accent of course If youre outside the United States youll notice he does have a little bit of an accent But of course he explains topics really well I mean theres no problem there I can understand it very very well He says he stopped learning new program languages He started learning at age 13 so hes been doing this for a while So thats a little bit about the overview Course content This is obviously the meat of the application of the course that is So he has a getstarting getstarted This is really just how to set up Vue locally kind of the basics you expect in any sort of course And then he goes into interacting with the DOM Most tutorials in Vuejs kind of have this flow right here They always go interacting with the DOM Like how do you deal with a Vue instance How do you raw output HTML The double brackets binding things like that Twoway data binding I kind of skim through a lot of this dynamic styling This is all really good stuff And then V4 Vf the directives Thats where he goes into next This is real good Now Ill have to say he does kind of interlay in different courses Inside the course he puts different projects which I really like I like my tutorials where I have lots of information and then some way to tie it all in So its just not kind of that boring Heres Vf directive heres this How can we tie it into a bigger kind of something a little bit bigger maybe a little more real world So this is his first course project the Monster Slayer So it kind of goes over some of the concepts so thats perfect And then he kind of goes back into the Vue instance It gets a little bit more technical how to update the DOM Then really a lot of courses and I did this too with my book is you start with kind of the basics using Vue as a CDN Youre importing it into your HTML files But really the way that most modern Vue apps are created is with Webpack and Vue CLI because it gives you access to something called single file components which he goes over these vue files which makes creating your Vue applications much easier because you really want to be able to build your application to a bunch of different components And if youre not if you just bring it in through an HTML and the CDN its a little more difficult And you also get some other kind of nice things with it with Scope CSS and a few other things So its definitely well worth it And he looks like he you know he covers it pretty well in this Vue pack CLI Then he goes deep dives into components This is kind of smart because you can do definitely definitely before you learn about Vue pack Webpack and Vue CLI you can do components I kind of wish he would have taught a little bit more of that before this section but its it works either way So he talks about it here the root component better folder structures Definitely talking about props how to pass things in between different components This is a really fundamental feature of Vue Its youre kind of having all these building blocks these components you definitely need to talk to them And it kind of dovetails nicely into Vue X which he talks about later But you could talk about props the event bus which is a little bit more sophisticated way to move information between Vue It does have a little bit of advanced components Slots is a way you can kind of put information in there And then he has another course So like I said hes really good about this He shows a lot of these different concepts and then he ties it back into a course or an actual project which I think makes it all solidify a lot easier I mean its not the greatest Its just kind of a simple app but I think it kind of helps bring all these concepts together I know some courses the projects are pretty much the whole course Like you have a project and then you bring in the different things I guess it just depends on your teaching style I kind of prefer if its more course more projects than than the not And then user input directives like creating custom directives So these these are a little bit more advanced You could definitely taught these a little bit earlier I think in the course But I mean theyre fine where they are Animations transitions Now I thought this interesting Now he does teach view resource which is not on the official recommendation list anymore for VJS It was kind of not recommended by Avenue He created a blog post about that a while ago and Im pretty sure this course was before that So I would just skip this whole V resource I mean this would not I would not use it I mean you can still use it but I would just skip it because its not really officially recommended I mean it still works but theres Axios and some other libraries that work just as well And he actually goes into that later So routing is pretty important here It goes into a lot of different writing examples And then this is probably the best section I think of his whole of the whole course is view X because you can be a very complicated subject and he does definitely break it down I just did a video on view X a little bit earlier this year and I kind of did that same approach Just try to I actually even did more I tried to take everything he taught in like three hours and I condensed it to about 10 minutes So just really the basics of using view X And its a lot It can be a lot easier than than it looks like This goes into excruciating detail now and even goes in at the end He starts doing like separating into different modules and auto namespacing and all that which is interesting And then he ties it into the shock trader which is probably you could probably start here and learn everything all the concepts This is probably the best project he has in the whole inside the whole course And it looks like at the end he has these bonus sections and I think that he just added these later because just kind of pad up the well actually Well in the case this this one the V resource V resources is kind of going kind of not officially recommended anymore So he did an axial section By the way this deploying section is pretty sparse I dont think youre going to get much out of this deploy section if I had one little criticism of it But its nice Its nice Its in here and authentication view apps I really like this He even goes into guards which is kind of protected routes off guards Its really the great the way you want to do authentication Thats kind of a common question I always hear too when people are learning these single page application frameworks Like how do you do authentication You know how do we how do we do that And this this goes over it This is this is a pretty good way of doing it And he uses Firebase in the back end I actually my book I use Firebase to Its just a real easy way of of demonstrating how to do these type of things without having to create your whole back end and muddle everything up And then he I guess he added form input and validation So he adds this and another like plug in And I didnt see anywhere through here Theres a couple other things like view to fi which is pretty popular I didnt see anything on view to fi here anywhere So thats kind of a real popular library Its kind of like bootstrap you can use for the view world But I mean overall I mean its an excellent course So I was really impressed by it I mean Maximilian he goes over it very well You know I would highly recommend this course to anyone thats want to jump into view and get your feet wet on it And Im really interesting Maybe later Ill go back and Ill look at some of the other VJS two courses and let you know kind of what my feelings are Like I said I know Anthony Gores is pretty good too But yeah so if you like this this review can I go ahead and just pay for it Just click on that link below I get a couple of bucks if you buy any courses through it And I would buy its on sale now for like eleven bucks for twenty two hours Its not a bad deal So thanks everybody Leave a comment below Let me know what you guys think of this course Id be interested to hear Thanks\n",
            "Reference summary for testing sample 209: Hello everyone this is Reshma from Edureka and Im very excited to take up my first live session here on YouTube So thank you all for joining this session on Git And in this session well majorly focus on the different workflows on Git and how to handle merge conflicts when they arise So this is the agenda for today So well take a brief introduction to Git Youll see all the Git commands that we use the different Git workflows that different dev teams follow and how to handle merge conflicts in each of the workflows So this is the short agenda for today Now let us take a brief look at what is Git and what does it actually do So Git is a version control software that is mainly used in software development to manage your code better And how exactly does it manage your code better It helps by keeping versions of your code So lets say that you have got your source code file and in time youll keep making changes to it Maybe like adding new features or doing bug fixes And sometimes you would want to go back to the previous versions because the newly added features might not be working out the way you want to or because of any other reasons And Git will help you to roll back because it has been keeping snapshots every time you change something And these snapshots are known as version one So lets say that this is your initial code You made some other changes in the initial code Theyll keep a version for that And similarly as time passes by it will keep different versions And whenever you want to go back to any of the working versions you can do that with the help of Git So this is how Git helps in code management So now let us take a look at the Git basic commands So if you want to create repositories lets say you want to create your local repository you just have to initialize it using Git init Or if there is an existing repository you can use Git clone If you want to make changes in your file you can use different commands You can use Git status to see whether a file is there in your index or not You can use Git add in order to add a file on your index And you can finally use Git commit in order to commit those changes that you have made Were syncing in repositories So you know that in Git we deal with two repositories the central and a local So you have to inform your local repository that which is your central repository that basically lies on a remote machine So for that we add origin We add the link of the central repository using this command git promote add origin And then if you want to pull all the files that are in the existing central repository use a git pull And then finally if you want to reflect your changes into the central repository you can use git push For parallel development we have got git branch It allows you to branch off from your main branch and you can work on different features on a completely isolated branch using git branch And then you can finally also merge all those changes in your production deployable branch which is usually the master branch using git merge And then we can also use git rebase Now this is a special kind of merge So it basically does the same thing as git merge only the commit workflow or the commit working tree looks a little bit different So youll know about that because well be using rebase in todays session So now let us take a look at the git workflows So basically the git workflows can be categorized into broadly three kinds So there is the centralized workflow where there is one central repository and only one working branch which is the master branch And there is the feature branch workflow where you have dedicated branches for each feature And then youve got git flow So well take a look at all of this and how to solve conflicts in each of these workflows So now let us talk about the centralized workflow So the centralized workflow uses a central repository to serve as a single point of entry for all changes to the project And there is only one default development branch and it is called the master And all changes are committed into this branch So this workflow does not require any branches besides the master So what the developers do they start by cloning the central repository into their local repository And in their own local copies of the project they will edit the files commit changes but you should know that these commits are stored locally Theyre completely isolated from the central repository And if the developers want the changes in the central repository theyll have to git push it So now lets say that we have got three people We have got Bob Alice and Jake And they are working on a project X So now lets say that Bob here makes the changes in the project commits it and then pushes it into the central repository So his changes will be published into the repository with his recent commits And now lets say that Alice is also working on the same thing and she wants to publish her changes in the central repository But since Bob and Alice change the same file in the same line there will be a conflict So let me show you how exactly does it happen and how to solve it So here I have created repositories for Bob and Alice So they are just in my system at different folders Since I have to show you the scenario I have to pretend to be two persons at one time So what Ill do Ill just click Git Bash here Now Im using Git for Windows so you just dont have to do anything You just click Git Bash here and it will open up the Git Bash shell And the same thing Im going to do for Alice over here So let me just adjust the screens so that you can see what Im doing in both of these Git Bash shells So I hope that you can see the screen over here So this is Bobs local repository shell that were using and this is for Alice So the first thing that you need to do you need to initialize your repository So for that you have to use Git Init And Ill do the same thing for Alice Its done and now what Im going to do I have already set up my central repository on GitHub So Ill just add the origin using Git Remote Add Origins So Ill do that for Bob Ill use this command Git Remote Add Origin And now you need to provide the link of your central repository that is on GitHub So Ill just go to my GitHub So you can find the link over here So you just copy it Paste it And Ill do the same thing again for Alice All right So now there are files that are existing in my central repository already So I want to pull those files So for that Ill just use this command Git Pull Origin Master So it has pulled all those files Ill do the same thing for Alice again So now if you see their repositories so this is Bobs repository It has pulled all the files from my central repository And this is the githidden folder This gets created when you initialize your repository specifically when we typed Git Init All right So now let us assume that Bob has made some changes So lets say this file over here So Im just taking very simple examples So basically there will be code here just so that you can just understand the concepts of conflict Im just using simple text files So lets say that Bob has made some change like this Saved it And now Bob wants to commit these changes So first Bob will check the Git status to see Sorry So Git status will show you whether a file has been added to the index or not So if it is in red it means that it has not been added to the index So for that well have to add this file So well use the command Git add and the name of our file So now if you check Git status So you can see that it is green now So it means that it has been added to the index It is there in the staging area and it is ready to be committed So now well use Git commit in order to commit this And also remember that we have to commit using a message So for Ill just pause this Bob changing And Eureka And Eureka So it is committed Now Bob wants to push it to the central repository So Ill use Git push origin master And its done So if you go to your central repository now So let me refresh this page So you can see Bobs commit over here So that means that this file has been changed in the central repository So now let us go to Alices local repository And lets say that Alice does not know that Bob has already made changes in the central repository and she is doing her work in her own local repository And she has changed the file something like this So well close it Now Alice will also do the same thing She will add the file And then she will commit the file So let me just keep it simple Ill just write Alice over here And now she would want to push it The same way that Bob has done Git push origin master And since its a centralized workflow there is only the master branch So you can see that there is an error that has been rejected The updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally So it means that something was changed in the central repository which Alices local repository doesnt contain And now it is centralized workflow And I dont want to mess around with my master branch because my master branch is supposed to always be and my master branch is always supposed to keep the production deployable code So instead of just pulling it directly Ill use rebase So what rebase will do is that it will always have the initial commits that will come from the central repository It will just add up my commits on top of that workflow or my working tree that shows all my commits So Ill show how it works So for that Ill not just pull it directly Ill use a different command Get pull rebase origin master So it is showing that there is a conflict in the content and it is an edurekatxt And even this message doesnt appear and youre confused where the conflict is You can do one thing Let me first clear the screen You can use git status to see where the conflicting file is So you can see that edurekatxt So in order to solve this conflict Ill use git merge tool So you can see it has opened up three files So this is the file that Bob has changed Was the original file and this is what Alice have changed Right So Alice can take a look and this is the head where her initial commit right now points to So she can decide whether to keep the changes or not And lets say that Alice wants to edit it She wants to solve the conflict And lets say that she decides that she wants to keep both the two lines So lets remove all that Save that file Again save and exit Save and exit Save and exit All right So now you can continue rebasing So for that you can use this command Okay Let me clear my screen so that you can see what Im typing So you can use this command git rebase continue So it has applied my last commit that I was trying to push it on to my central repository So now the merge conflict is solved and I should be an or lets say Alice should be successfully be able to push it to the central repository So lets try it Okay And the conflict is solved and it is successfully pushed onto the central repository So let me just show it to you So here is Alices commit So this is how you deal with conflicts when you are using a centralized workflow So I hope that this is clear So now let us talk about the feature branch workflow So if your team is comfortable with the centralized workflow but they want to streamline its collaboration efforts and it is definitely worth exploring the benefits of the feature branch workflow So what happens here is that you dedicate an isolated branch to each feature And because of this it is possible to initiate indepth discussions around the new additions before you try to integrate them into the official project So the core idea behind this feature branch workflow is that all feature development should take place in a dedicated branch instead of the master branch And this encapsulation actually makes it easier for multiple developers to work on a particular feature without disturbing the main code base because again Im telling you the master branch should always contain production deployable code So it also means that the master branch will never contain broken code And this is going to be a huge advantage when youre dealing with continuous integration environments So again let us consider the scenario This is a feature branch workflow So theyre all working on the features So lets say that Jake here is working on feature B and Alice and Bob are again working on feature A So again first Bob makes a new branch and he pushes that new branch where he has added some features and he has pushed it into the central repository And then again Alice wants to push it again And then the same things that she might have some changes that she might have done in the central repository So then there is an advantage of using the pull request So pull requests are a way to initiate discussions around a branch So they give other developers the opportunity to sign off on a feature branch before its get integrated into the official project So let me just show you an example of this again So open up this repositories again So this is Bobs repository So lets say that Bob wants to now branch off and work on his new feature So he just can use this command over here get branch and lets say his feature is called feature one So now lets check out the feature one So now Bob is in the feature one branch So lets say he wants to add something All right So just see what happens All right So just save and exit And now again Bob wants to add this file All right He will commit this file And now he would want to push this branch onto the central repository So for that hell just use the same command get push origin and the name of his branch And this will actually create a different branch in the central repository with the same name and it will serve as a remote tracking branch And it is done So if you go to the central repository now you can see that less than a minute ago there was a new branch here which is called the feature one So if you go check out this branch in GitHub you can see it has got this file along with the other files because it was actually branched off from the master with the latest commit where it contained all the files Right So now if Bob wants Alice to know that he has made some changes because now theyre working in a featured branch workflows so he will file a pull request So how to do that in GitHub you just have to go here Just click this button new pull request The base should be master branch and compare the feature one And then you can add some comments over here so you can just create and just lets say that Please check it out So if you want reviews on your branch whether you have done or developed the feature in the correct way or not you can actually add reviewers here and you can you can actually add reviewers here and you can actually also assign someone here So now since my GitHub only have me as a collaborator I dont have anyone else So you can add other people who are actually contributing onto this center repository And then finally you can click this button Oops All right There seems to be some internet issues with GitHub All right But the good part is that Im actually done with that You dont have to do anything after you have created that pull request So what will happen after that is that whoever you add as a reviewer so they will either get a mail of how you set it up So they get a mail and then you can also comment and therell be a back and forth discussion about what to change or not And finally you have to merge it when it has been set So when youre all the when the entire Im so sorry When your entire team is satisfied on the feature that you have worked on So someone will finally merge it onto the master branch So this was all about the feature branch So pull requests come in handy when to when you want to carry out discussions with your entire team So now let us talk about Git flow So Git flow workflow defines a strict branching model that is designed around the project release So this is somewhat more complicated than feature branch workflow but this provides a robust framework for managing larger projects So this is what the entire branching model kind of looks like So you dont have to worry even though it looks very complex this workflow does not add any new concepts or commands beyond whats required for the feature branch workflow Instead the difference is that it assigns very specific roles to different projects The difference is that it assigns very specific roles to different branches and defines how and when they should interact So in addition to feature branches it uses individual branches for preparing maintaining and recording releases And of course you also get to leverage all the benefits of feature branch workflow the pull requests the isolated experience experiments that you do on your feature branches and more efficient collaboration So how does it work So the Git flow workflow uses a central repository as a communication hub for all developers just like all other workflows And the developers again work locally and push branches onto the central repository So the only difference is the branch structure of the project So instead of a single master branch so this workflow uses two branches to record the history of the project So the master branch here actually stores the official release history and then develop branch that serves as an integration branch for features And it is very convenient to tag all the commits in the master branch as different versions So here you have tagged it as version 10 101 then 110 something like this So whatever naming scheme that you are comfortable with So you have got feature branches So there are two feature branches mostly One is there which majorly focuses on the coming release And the other needs to be worked on for a coming release or a future release So when a feature is complete it gets merged back to the develop branch And feature branch should never interact directly with the master So feature branches combined with develop branch for all intended purposes to the feature branch workflow but the git workflow does not stop there So once develop has acquired enough features for a release or lets say a release date is coming up so what do you do You fork a release branch off to develop And creating this branch starts the next release cycle So no new features can be added at this point So you can only do bug fixes and hot fixes and patching up things And once it is ready to ship the release gets merged onto the master And tagged with the version number So this is how git flow works So obviously youll also find merge conflicts here But it is very easy to fix because it is more in a structured way And when you have a lot of people working on a particular application especially larger applications you can use git flow for that And in most of the companies people use git flow So all you have to do you have to create feature branches you have to create a develop branch and you have to follow the git flow So just flow with the git flow And so here are the different workflows I hope that you have understood something you have learned something new And I have shown you in a very bare minimum ways just so that you can get the concepts So all right so if you have any questions you can leave it on the comment section below And Im very glad to announce that Edureka has finally launched their DevOps

            "Reference summary for testing sample 309: This is the first farm on Mars Okay technically its not on Mars Its Wyoming So close enough Anyway it could be on Mars Because this is one of the worlds most advanced indoor farms And it could be the future of farming right here on Earth With vertical farming you can start with a building roughly the size of a Costco grow your crops up and down instead of around you on the floor ditch the pesticides recycle the water and you can grow pretty much anywhere anytime Why do this Well look at this Its all of the farmland in the world All of that used to be nature It is probably one of the most defining acts of humanity We literally changed the ecosystem of the entire planet in order to meet our dietary needs Plants today produce roughly what they produced 10 20 years ago Weve just managed to pack more of them into a field And there is a limit to that type of yield gain Our job is to build the farms that unlock nutrition for everyone on a scale that no ones ever seen And the only way we can do that now is by growing indoors Indoors Dont you need sunlight and rain to grow the worlds food Maybe not This is Hard Reset a series about rebuilding our world from scratch So pods are where we do almost all of our environmental research This is where we understand what drives flavor what drives appearance what drives yield in all of the different crops that we grow Why would we want to farm vertically Well theres a reason that libraries dont spread their books all over the floor They stack them up on shelves so that they can stack a lot of books in a small footprint Vertical farms do the same thing for agriculture And while vertical farms are not new companies like Plenty are leading the charge at making them mainstream Okay this is Nates story Plenty So going vertical allows us to put a lot more product in a single spot It allows us to circulate Aries or administer Lighties It allows us to have massive growing plants We can condense about 700 acres of farmland into the size of a big box retail store And we harvest 365 days a year We are able to condense the growth cycle to about 10 days for a lot of our products which is about a 700 increase in yield We are doing that all while saving about a million gallons of water per week and using about 1 of the land compared to traditional farming In an indoor farm we put water in the roots So when they take the water up they transpire that water And then that water gets sucked into our air handling units We condense it all and put it right back in the system So 99 of the water thats transpired in the field and lost is captured and recirculated in our farms We have you know strawberries in another space Weve got an upstairs space devoted to tomatoes Overall weve got over 50 different you know discrete spaces that we use to do these tests Historically vertical farming has been too expensive and too inefficient to make it a better option than traditional farming But thats all changing now as these technologies drop in price Humanity is on that cost curve right now We just dont realize it Were riding this cost curve down to a future where almost anything is possible in an extremely controlled environment Thats not to say one of these vertical farms is cheap A new facility can cost 100 million to install but the cost of each component is plummeting as industries like solar and robotics are flourishing But the surprising technology thats helped make this possible is LEDs What vertical farms use to replicate the sun Lets break that down Our system is just a system of energy transfers And our ability to manage the efficiency of those energy transfers in some way or another is what makes us economical or noneconomical as a business Sounds crazy but like most everything in the world right like we can only save our species if it makes economic sense You know life and death Lets make sure that we can afford it right Right Nate gets it Basically an LEDs efficiency comes down to how little loss there is between the grids electricity and the amount of light it puts out Then how much light is actually absorbed and used by the plant We think about LEDs as like the point of major energy loss in the system Were taking electrons and converting them into photons And thanks to all your TV and cell phone and light bulb buying LED technology has gotten really really efficient And Plenty is getting really good at putting out the kind of light that actually results in plant growth and plant flavor LEDs have just been going down down down in price and up up up in efficiency And our understanding of what makes a good photon versus a bad photon at the plant level has been going up up up as weve been researching and working Were really kind of transitioning into a world where humans and machines are partnering together in better and better ways to make farming awesome Plenty is not vaporware Its already on the market Their first farm in the San Francisco Bay Area has produce available at local stores today Its premium price but its not unaffordable Plenty is banking on their produce being better and more flavorful than produce from traditional farms What we can do with nutrients and lights is we can change the flavor profile of our plants So things like a blue light can make a more crispy crunch on a plant like our kale The kale is like nothing like a kale you would think of Its like soft Its kind of sweet Its crunchy So I make a pesto out of it that I really love I sampled Plentys products and theyre not wrong The baby arugula baby kale and mizuna mixes all have a ton of flavor And that kale pesto that Shereen mentioned So good And because farms like Plenty use a tremendous amount of automation these plants have actually never even been touched by human hands When you grow things outside the elements are much more unpredictable If you grow indoors you can control a lot of those factors in ways that arent accessible to outdoor growers And the result is that our produce can be hundreds of times cleaner Plenty doesnt need to use pesticides because there are no bugs Its produce doesnt have bird poop on it because why would you put birds inside a warehouse It results in a product thats so clean you dont need to wash it And thats a huge step forward for human health and safety Faster unhealthy food dominates peoples diets but thats partially because alternative produce for most is kind of gross Could be the best tasting lettuce and tomato hamburger ever So globally we eat about one third of the fresh fruits and vegetables that we should be consuming Thats a huge problem Thats why we see the rise of heart disease and diabetes and all of these different things in places where people used to just struggle to get enough calories right And what weve done in the last really like 50 years is weve figured out how to trick our bodies into wanting to eat the wrong things Humanity is trapped in our addiction to those calories And we dont have the land or the resources or the ability to compensate with high nutrition food Most produce has been packed up and shipped off to another country or transported across state lines via trucks and trains Thats not great for the environment and it also sucks for the flavor of your produce Many products like tomatoes are like designed for durability because they got to be shipped across the country in these like massive trucks and not for flavor So our products can last longer on shelves because theyre not spending three or four days on a truck Were able to concentrate on quality over the ability to ship And so this is in a lot of ways the democratization of flavor Right now we are really focused on building our facility in Compton Were in the middle of construction and hoping to open that facility in the next year or so Compton is a food desert So were bringing jobs to communities that really are looking for investment in people These arent seasonal jobs Theyre fulltime jobs 365 days a year at living wages Being able to grow in communities anywhere means that we will be able to offer that produce to places that traditionally havent had access I mean thats what we can do is we can create local farms everywhere With their San Francisco and Compton facilities plenty will only be growing leafy greens and shorter plants Tall crops like wheat or corn dont make much sense to farm vertically But that may all change in the decades to come So picture a scenario where we got rid of all the traditional farms and replaced them with just vertical farms Fresh produce could be grown in arid places like Cairo and Phoenix or frigid places like Helsinki and Calgary Every place in the world would be able to grow the same crops grown in California and Tuscany How would that change diets and cuisines and our impact on the environment The businesses and lives of people associated with traditional farming would be severely disrupted Farming communities would lose their identities But does that outweigh the potential benefits That hard reset is one where the vast majority of our food is grown indoors Its grown in a completely protected environment under artificial light You know given exactly the nutrients it needs its hyperproductive its in the cities or in the regions where the people live And humanity is fully untethered from the environment in terms of how our population grows We can go anywhere and grow these crops in almost any conditions now We can expand kind of this human consciousness of flavor in ways that were never possible when we were seasonally locked into production cycles This is the kind of technology and efficiency well need with the Artemis base on the moon and eventually on Mars But its also kind of what we need here on Earth We can give the world back a lot We can give the world back land We can give back the jungles of Borneo to the orangutan We can give back the Amazon to the planet We can give back the Midwest to the buffalo We can give back the things that weve taken And we can be a lot less extractive\n",
            "Reference summary for testing sample 740:  Welcome back Aliens My name is Abin Reddy and lets continue with this series on JavaScript Now in this video well talk about arithmetic operators Now see when you talk about a language or you talk about software you perform some operations right Now it can be calculations it can be logical operations but here lets focus on calculations and we do that a lot on computers as well right So lets say if you want to add two numbers you want to subtract two numbers you want to find a division of a number you can do that and for it you need to use certain operators and the thing is in the earlier videos we have talked about most of them but still you know just to complete that topic lets talk about In fact once we reach to the end of the video well talk about some important operators and some tricky parts So lets get started So what well do is I will create a variable here num and usually the value of number will be lets say one and I want to perform some addition subtraction multiplication division just to show you that So what I will do here is I will take another number here which is result and with this number I will perform that operation or maybe just to make it more effective like lets take some other numbers so that we can perform all the required operations lets say four and two and we know because what happens when you use these simple numbers easy to calculate at least in our mind So what I will do is I will say num one plus num two and we know it right this is addition operator So well print it and well print result okay this is the addition of two numbers and then well print lets run this code and lets see what happens if you run this code you got six that is that is good and now I want to find the subtraction its very simple so just we are trying to complete that as soon as possible because its very simple in fact in the earlier video we also talked about what happens when you have different types of data and when you apply these operators but as of now just to keep it simple we are going for numbers right we can actually also perform the division operator when you divide you can say we got two in fact you can also divide the number by zero which will give you infinity you can also divide the number by a string it will give you a nan you can you can try those things right but then we know what is addition subtraction division can you multiply yes with the help of this hash trick symbol and if you run this code we got eight so basic operation is very easy right what about if you want to find a remainder so in this case well use a percentage operator so lets try and we should get zero right so four divided by two and the remainder is zero so we can try with other numbers as well lets say if you have a number is five and then if you find a remainder by doing that with two you will get one okay this is working so no issues with this thing right and then if you have two strings I mean string and a string it will give you concatenation right but what happens example lets say the num one is not actually a number but its a boolean value true and num two is also true and the operation you want to perform here is addition now what will happen pause this video go to comment section and type the answer what do you think what is the answer here now logically it can be true because if you know the concept of complex logical operations so when you have two truths it might be something like that or it might be nan because you cant add boolean values lets try what happens I hope you have answered that in the comment section we got two why why we got two here thats weird so its actually very simple remember when we talked about truthy value and falsy values whenever you have a true and if you try to convert that because we are using a plus operator here right now type conversion it says okay when you have a plus operator and on both the side you have boolean values let me convert them for you so this number will be converted into numbers and the first number so zero is false so one is true and thats why we got two right so one plus one is two very simple okay this works now whatever what I want to do is let me just remove result for time being and let me also remove num two lets only focus on num one here and when you have only one num lets go with num and here let me print num okay lets go with number four again and let me run this code and you can see we got four let me just clear the screen now what I will do is I will just add this number by itself so what I will do is I will say num is equal to num plus two so what Im doing is Im taking that number four Im adding two so this makes sense right so it should give you six because here what we are doing is we are taking the value of num which is four four plus two is six then it will assign thats how it goes so first it will try to solve this expression okay this is the expression what is the expression whenever you have something which will be getting resolved to a value it is expression example num plus two is expression five plus two is expression high is an expression five is an expression because were going to assign five to a number so here we are saying num plus two is an expression which will be assigned to num which is six in this case and you got the answer now when you want to add a number by itself example we are adding num by two right so we can use a shorthand so instead of using this syntax let me just comment this here so we can use double slash to comment a code and then we can use shortcut so we can say we want to add num itself so we can say num plus so we want to add num itself with two okay this is this is called shorthand operators so instead of using this syntax we can use this so we are saying we want to add num by itself plus two lets try and it worked right it worked so we can also do that with the number one so lets say if you want to do this operation which is num equal to num plus one in this case we can say num plus equal to one so this should also work we should get five but specifically when you have only one you can actually use a special operator which is called num plus plus plus plus operator so it also means increment so if num is five it will give you six if num is six it will give you seven so num plus plus is an increment and thats why if you know theres a language called c and c plus plus c was the initial version c plus plus is the next increment of c right so thats why they went with c plus plus name oh we have not seen the output yet it still works right so instead of using num equal to num plus one we can say num plus plus okay so this is how you can increment what about if you want to do this num equal to num minus one any guess you guessed it right we can use num minus minus right and this works so plus plus will increment minus minus will decrement in fact the fun part is you can actually use plus plus at the start so you can either say num plus plus or you can say plus plus num both will give you the same answer in this case okay why i said in this case actually the thing is they both have different names this is called this syntax which we are using here is called pre increment and when you say num plus plus this is called post increment in fact there should be a separate video talking about these things but lets try to do that here itself so we got num plus plus and we got plus plus num one is pre increment and one is post increment whats the difference see in both this case example even if you try this syntax or this syntax it will ultimately give you the next iteration right so what im doing is i will run this code what is your guess what will be the output it should be six right because here we are saying plus plus num which will make this number four to five so this is five here and at this point we are saying num plus plus it will make it six so if i run this code we got six so this is working right but we still dont know the difference between pre increment and post increment let me do that oh before even before going ahead what if you have minus minus num and num minus minus what it will be called pre decrement post decrement right so name changes but just to understand the difference between this two lets go with this example here so what i will do now is let me get another variable which is x equal to and i will say x plus plus okay so now what we are doing is we are incrementing num that makes sense and then we are assigning the value to x so this is an expression which will give you a value and that value we are assigning to x and then let me print x here actually let me print both let me print x and then let me also print num and lets see whats the difference between these two numbers so what do you think even before running this code what is your guess and please also mention the timeline okay because the problem is in this video i have asked you for so many questions to answer that in the comment section so what you can do is for different answer you can give a timeline this at this point this is the answer so that it will be helpful for others to actually know what youre thinking so what sometimes you what happens you know when when you are learning something new and then if everyone is getting the right answer youre getting the wrong answer you feel bad but what if everyone is getting the wrong answer and youre getting the right answer you feel good what if everyone is getting wrong answer you feel way better because not everyone knows about it its a its a good feeling okay so come back so here we are doing that and let me see what happens before that i will clear the screen and run and you can see we got four and five so we got here four oh thats weird why we got four see num five makes sense because we are incrementing it why we got four here its because this num plus plus is called post increment now what this post increment means so post increment just means that it will first fetch the value then it will assign the value so basically we have two operations here increment and assignment so we are assigning the value to x right and then we are also incrementing it which will happen first since this is post increment it will first assign the value then it will increment so before increment whats the value of num its so four will be assigned to x and then it will increment okay and thats why we got four for x and five for num what will happen when you do this now this time we are not doing post increment we are doing pre increment now you should be able to guess it right it should be five and five now why five five is because we are first incrementing it pre increment right pre so it is first incrementing it making it the value of five and then assigning to x which is five in this case so thats the difference between pre increment and post increment okay so before ending the video we have something more lets say i have this number four and i want to find a cube of this number how do you find a cube of a number its very simple let me say let result equal to you can say num into num into num so thats how you can find a cube of a number right the other way you can do is let me just run this code first let me just print the value in the console and lets see what happens you can see we got 64 but what if i want to do something else so we got a math class math interface of course well talk about class interface later but as of now we got something inbuilt so lets imagine we have inbuilt function called math that power and in this you can pass two parameters four comma three now what is four the actual value and then three is cube or if you want to find a square you will say two so this is actually a power so when you say three you are finding four raised to three which is four power three and thats why its a power power right so if you go over it it will say its a function or a method returns a value of a base expression x is the base value and y is the exponent value right so this you can use this and it will give the same answer right but then a new version which is es6 we got something new and that is using double star or double asteris so when you use single asterisk it is multiplication double asterisk means power and you can say we got the same answer if you want to find a square you can do that if you want to find four raised to four you can do that so thats with the help of the asterisk symbol double asterisk symbol so thats it from this video i hope you enjoyed let me in the comment section and do other videos bye\n",
            "Reference summary for testing sample 578: Im drawing a graph Doesnt it look cool But I didnt know how it worked until I watched StackQuest Hello and welcome to StackQuest StackQuest is brought to you by the friendly folks in the genetics department at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Today were going to be talking about TSNE or TISNE To be honest I dont actually know how its pronounced but its going to be clearly explained I know that bet Also this StackQuest is by request A couple of people put it in the comments below and I got a couple of emails from other people so Im doing it because you guys want it Here it goes If youre watching this StackQuest chances are youve seen an example of a TSNE graph before What TSNE does is it takes a high dimensional data set and reduces it to a low dimensional graph that retains a lot of the original information If youre not familiar with those terms of taking a high dimensional data set and reducing it to a low dimensional graph you might want to watch the StackQuest for PCA because I explain what that means in that video Heres a basic 2D scatter plot Lets do a walkthrough of how TSNE would transform this graph into a flat one dimensional plot on a number line Im going to use this super simple example to explain the concepts behind TSNE so that when you see it applied to a much larger data set a much more complex data set youll still know how that graph was drawn Note if we just projected the data onto one of the axes we just get a big mess that doesnt preserve the original clustering If we projected onto the yaxis instead of two distinct clusters we just see a mishmash And the same thing happens if we just project the data onto the xaxis What TSNE does is find a way to project data into a low dimensional space in this case the one dimensional number line so that the clustering in the high dimensional space in this case the two dimensional scatter plot is preserved So lets step through the basic ideas of how TSNE does this Well start with the original scatter plot Then well put the points on the number line in a random order From here on out TSNE moves these points a little bit at a time until it has clustered them Lets figure out where to move this first point Should it move a little to the left or a little to the right Because it is part of this cluster in the two dimensional scatter plot it wants to move closer to these points But at the same time these points are far away in the scatter plot so they push back These points attract while these points repel In this case the attraction is strongest so the point moves a little to the right Bam Now lets move this point a little bit These points attract because they are close to each other in the two dimensional scatter plot And this point repels a little bit because it is far from the point in the two dimensional scatter plot So it moves a little closer to the other orange points Double bam At each step a point on the line is attracted to points it is near in the scatter plot and repelled by points it is far from Triple bam Now that weve seen what TSNE tries to do lets dive into the nitty gritty details of how it does what it does Step 1 determine the similarity of all the points in the scatter plot For this example lets focus on determining the similarities between this point and all of the other points First measure the distance between two points Then plot that distance on a normal curve that is centered on the point of interest Lastly draw a line from the point to the curve The length of that line is the unscaled similarity I made that terminology up but it will make sense in just a bit so hold on Now we calculate the unscaled similarity for this pair of points Now we calculate the unscaled similarity for this pair of points And now we calculate the unscaled similarity for this pair of points Etc etc etc Using a normal distribution means that distant points have very low similarity values and close points have high similarity values Ultimately we measure the distances between all of the points and the point of interest Then plot them on a normal curve And then measure the distances from the points to the curve to get the unscaled similarity scores with respect to the point of interest The next step is to scale the unscaled similarities so that they add up to 1 Ummm why do the similarity scores need to add up to 1 It has to do with something I didnt tell you earlier And to illustrate the concept I need to add a cluster that is half as dense as the others The width of the normal curve depends on the density of data near the point of interest Less dense regions have wider curves So if these points have half the density as these points and this curve is half as wide as this curve then scaling the similarity scores will make them the same for both clusters Heres an example where Ive worked out the math This curve has a standard deviation equal to 1 These are the unscaled similarity values This curve has a standard deviation equal to 2 These points are twice as far from the middle The unscaled similarity values are half of the other ones To scale the similarity scores so that they sum to 1 you take a score and you divide it by the sum of all the scores That equals the scaled score Heres how the math works out when the distribution has a standard deviation equals to 1 We get 082 and 018 as the scaled similarity scores And heres the math for when everything is spread out twice as much We get 082 and 018 The similarity scores on top are equal to the similarity scores below Theyre the same That implies that the scaled similarity scores for this relatively tight cluster are the same for this relatively loose cluster The reality is a little more complicated but only slightly TSNE has a perplexity parameter equal to the expected density around each point And that comes into play but these clusters are still more similar than you might expect Now back to the original scatter plot Weve calculated similarity scores for this point Now we do it for this point And we do it for all the points One last thing and the scatter plot will be all set with similarity scores Because the width of the distribution is based on the density of the surrounding data points the similarity score for this node might not be the same as the similarity to this node So TSNE just averages the two similarity scores from the two directions No big deal Ultimately you end up with a matrix of similarity scores Each row and column represents the similarity scores calculated from that point of interest Red equals high similarity and white equals low similarity Ive drawn the similarity from a point of interest to itself as dark red However it doesnt really make sense to say that a point is similar to itself because that doesnt help the clustering So TSNE actually defines that similarity as zero Hooray Were done calculating similarity scores for the scatter plot Now we randomly project the data onto the number line and calculate similarity scores for the points on the number line Just like before that means picking a point measuring a distance and lastly drawing a line from the point to a curve However this time were using a Tdistribution A Tdistribution is a lot like a normal distribution except the T isnt as tall in the middle and the tails are taller on the ends The Tdistribution is the T in TSNE Well talk about why the Tdistribution is used in a little bit So using a Tdistribution we calculate unscaled similarity scores for all the points and then scale them like before Like before we end up with a matrix of similarity scores but this matrix is a mess compared to the original matrix The goal of moving this point is we want to make this row look like this row TSNE moves the points a little bit at a time and at each step it chooses a direction that makes the matrix on the left more like the matrix on the right It uses small steps because its a little bit like a chess game and cant be solved all at once Instead it goes one move at a time Bam Now to finally tell you why the Tdistribution is used Without it the clusters would all clump up in the middle and be harder to see Triple bam And now we know how TSNE works Ive used a really simple example here but the concepts are the exact same for more complicated datasets Hooray Weve made it to the end of another exciting StatQuest If you like this StatQuest and want to see more like it please subscribe And if you have any ideas for future StatQuests just put them in the comments below Until next time quest on\n",
            "Reference summary for testing sample 895: The Roman Empire included large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe North Africa and West Asia Military campaigns were sent across Europe and North Africa in order for Rome to expand more and more Their southern border was in North Africa at the beginning of the Sahara Desert This arid mostly uninhabitable place assured a natural border and defense between other civilizations But also it stopped the Roman expansion Little is known about Roman expeditions that existed beyond this point However the Romans had a few attempts on exploring deeper into the African continent SubSaharan Africa was explored by Roman expeditions between 19 BC and 19 AD most likely in an effort to locate the sources of valuable trade goods and establish routes to bring them to the seaports on the coast of North Africa thereby minimizing disruption in trade caused by conflicts among indigenous tribes and kingdoms Most of these expeditions began as military campaigns While the last one may have been initiated in the interests of trade relations but the purpose of all of them seems to have been in the interests of expanding

Kingdoms using my link in the description and use my code to claim your prizes Rome had established trade relationships with a number of kingdoms in Africa whose merchants brought goods for trade from the interior to the three great Roman centers on the North African coast Leptis Magna Oweya and Sabratha But the desire for even more goods and direct access to them prompted Roman excursions to the SubSaharan regions The five expeditions were in 19 BC and in 41 50 70 and 90 AD The cultural impact of the Roman expeditions on the SubSaharan cultures in fact is still debated among scholars Trade among the different kingdoms and tribes of Africa was already well established by the time the Phoenicians founded Carthage 332 BCE The overland trade routes connections and seaports had been used by African merchants for centuries and once the Carthaginians gained a foothold in North Africa contributed to the wealth prestige and power of their central city and others in the region Trade centers were already established on the North African coast by the seminomadic or nomadic Berber tribes of the region who traded with each other and may have exported goods elsewhere After 30 BCE following the death of Cleopatra VII Rome took Egypt and added it to its North African holdings which was a very important grain supply to Rome The empire was supplemented through the trade at the cities of Reggio and Tripolitania Rome had established trade relations with the other kingdoms as well From West Africa other traders also brought their items towards Tripolitania but these trade routes were often disrupted by conflicts between kingdoms or different tribes It has been suggested that one of the tribes involved in this regions trade were the Garamantes though this claim has been challenged It is not known if the Garamantes were directly involved in trade coming from West Africa However its possible that they interrupted trade through raids on caravans which sparked a response from Rome leading to the first of Roman expeditions Lucius Cornelius Babus 1st century BC was proconsul of Africa in 19 BCE when he was ordered by Augustus Caesar to put down the Garamantes who were in some way interfering with Roman interests in the Pheasant region of Libya Babus led 10000 legionaries from Sabrafa against the Berber tribe and conquered them Afterward and perhaps on his own initiative or on orders he sent a number of his men onward to explore the land of lions which lay on the other side of the Hagar mountains in the central Sahara region Babus men returned with the report of a large body of water now thought to be the Niger River and Roman coins and other artifacts have been found in the region supporting the claim that Babus men crossed the mountains and explored the region This evidence is debated Another expedition was led by Paulinus In the course of this campaign in 41 CE Paulinus led his men over the Atlas Mountains in southern Mauritania He reached the summit of the mountains after a 10day march and according to Pliny then traveled a significant distance down through the plains to explore along a river referred to as Gir and then the area around the Daris River modern Senegal River Evidence for Roman presence in this region comes from artifacts and coins discovered there many in and around the city of Akzujd In 50 AD one Septimus Flaccus led an expedition from Leptis Magna against a rebellious tribe which was disrupting trade in the region controlled by the socalled Garamantes Who Flaccus was is equally unclear as he is not identified with any legion and no earlier mention is made of him Some scholars have suggested that the geographer Ptolemy who wrote the account of Flaccus expedition based on an earlier source got his name wrong Probably this was the case or he may have omitted information he felt was unnecessary Flaccus must have had some military background however in order to command a force that led them successfully against whatever group of people was causing the problem in the southern regions Usually military commanders were sent in military expeditions This possible general marched into Garamantes territory and subdued them He then travelled on over the Tibesti Mountains and into the land known as Agassimba which was north of a great body of water known as the Lake of Hippopotamus and Rhinoceros This lake has been identified as Lake Chad Flaccus expedition is the first one known to have interacted with the populace of this region at any length but no details are available on what this contact consisted of Scholars agree that Agassimba was to the north of Lake Chad but as the lake was much larger at the time precisely where it was how large the region and who lived there is unknown It is assumed it was controlled by the Garamantes However Festus concluded business with the Garamantes They seem to have been on friendly terms with Rome 20 years later when one Julius Maternus led an expedition into their territories The problem with sources regarding this expedition is that it is unclear who Maternus was and what position diplomat merchant or military commander he held There is no mention of Maternus before or after this expedition and details of the excursion itself seem to support any of the three possibilities He traveled in the company of the Garamanian king and so as a diplomat could have been forging better political relations as a merchant forging better trade relations as a general helping the king to put down rebellious subjects which would have benefited them both Anyway whoever he was and whatever position he held Maternus success seems to have been based on the reports of the expeditions which went before him Like Flaccus he crossed the Tibesti Mountains and explored Agassimba and like Festus and Babus explored the region around the Niger River However an expedition was also sent to go find to sources of the Nile and went beyond the Sedan All these expeditions were supported by legionnaires and had mainly a commercial purpose Only the one conducted by the emperor Nero seemed to be a preparative for the conquest of Ethiopia or Nubia In 1662 AD two legionnaires explored the source of the Nile One of the main objectives of the exploration was to locate and obtain gold using camels to transport it over land back to Roman provinces in the Mediterranean coast Sea voyages between Rome and North Africa conversely could be completed in less than a month and so were much more lucrative and further safer for both investors and crew Although there is no defining document explicitly stating why the overland expeditions were launched it is reasonable to conclude based on the nature of the military campaigns and the Roman independence on African goods why the Romans didnt expand deeper into Africa is because of a multitude of reasons But this is a topic for another video Again a big thank you to our sponsor Rise of Kingdoms Also a new

            "Reference summary for testing sample 545: So as we have spoken earlier we need a way to represent complex data types in C So lets say we talk about a single point in threedimensional space It has an int x int y and int z So we need a way to represent all three of them together as a single block All three put together represents a point in space So we need to have a data type lets say point which says a single point consists of x y and zaxis Similarly lets have another example that you can see on your screen Its a coordinate system Any address on Earth is represented by a latitude and a longitude A latitude is a floating point number followed by a character which says whether its north south east or west Similarly the longitude also is a floating point number followed by the direction So now all these four put together tells you the coordinates of a particular point on Earth So if youre going to write a program in C which is going to store the coordinates of a particular location then its simpler to have a single block called coordinates instead of having four different variables To do that we can define all the four variables within a single structure So in C a structure is a collection of multiple variables of different types They can be of the same type too but the whole idea is youre trying to store everything as a structure So most of the time theyre all of different types Structures are used to basically create userdefined data types Like you can see here we wanted a new data type called coordinate So we created a structure called structcoord Then within that we have said that the coordinate consists of a latitude a float longitude a character which is latitude underscore direction and another character longitude underscore direction So what you see here is a syntax for defining a structure in C You have the keyword struct followed by the name of the structure that you want to give curly braces Then you can have all the variables that belong to the particular structure And finally you close the curly braces and a semicolon So now weve defined a userdefined data type called structcoord Now we shall go ahead and see how were going to use this structure How do we access its members How do we copy data to it And so on So like I said we have now declared a userdefined data type and its called structcoord So before we can start using it we have to first declare a variable of that type To declare a variable of any type is simple So in this case you just say structcoord and then c1 So now we have a variable c1 which is of the type structcoord So c1 itself consists of four individual variables So within c1 you have a float latitude you have a character latitude underscore direction you have a float longitude and you have a char longitude underscore direction To initialize the structure c1 you say c1 equal to curly braces and values for all the four members which are part of the structure So 2717 becomes the latitude The letter n is the latitude underscore direction 7804 is the longitude And the letter e is longitude underscore direction Okay so now that we have initialized the variable 2 how do we access each individual member in the structure To access the members of a structure we use the dot operator So you say variable name dot member name So in this case the variable name is c1 the member name is latitude So I say c1 dot latitude equal to 2717 Or if I want to print the latitude on the screen I can just say printf percentage d c1 dot latitude But latitude is float so youll say percentage f Similarly you say printf percentage c c1 dot lat underscore direction Simple So you say variable name dot member name Also just so we can have basic variables within a structure you can have other structures also within structures These are called nested structures So lets say I have another structure in my program I can make that structure part of a new structure that Im going to declare to We shall see how were going to do that And finally now that weve declared a new data type every data type has a size We know that integers are generally 4 bytes a character is 1 byte So what is the size of a structure The size of a structure is basically the sum of all of its members But the size of a structure is not simply the sum It may sometimes be greater than the sum of all of its members And the next slide we shall see why Before that were going to take another simple example of using structures and write a program for the same So lets take another real life example When we want to represent a person a person consists of a first name and a last name Its just not a name alone right So youre talking about the name of a person it can be first name last name or first name middle name last name So for this example were going to assume that a person has a first name and a last name So how do we represent that in C So first lets just include stdioh Now were going to define a new data type called name struct name Now the name itself consists of two parts the first name and the last name So youre going to say char first name size 50 so you have up to 50 characters char last name 50 Finally close this So thats our structure Generally you define structures outside of any function because its a data type and you can use the data type anywhere But once youve defined the function you can have variables of that Once youve defined the structure you can have variables of the structure within any function and that variable becomes local to that function So lets have int main Now I want to store the name of a student so lets declare a variable of the type name So I say struct name student So now we want the user to enter his or her name and were going to store it in the variable student Printf enter your first name The first name is a character array or like we say its a string You can of course use scanf to accept strings from the user but a better way to accept strings is use the getAs function As scanf with s has some issues you cannot accept strings with spaces in it getAs is a simpler one so you say getAs And now we want to accept the first name so you say studentfname Next you want the last name so printf Enter your last name getAs studentlname Now finally before we exit the program we want to see if weve stored the name correctly Made a mistake here So lets print both the values so printf Now remember that to print a structure C does not understand what type is that structure so you can access only each member of the structure So in C if you want to print a structure you cannot print it as it is You can only print every member individually Just the way we had to accept the first name separately and store it in first name accept the last name then store it in last name Similarly when Im printing it I can print just one member at a time I cannot just say printf some special keyword and give just the structure name as student So if I have to print the first name and the last name of the student I have to say printf first name percentage s studentfname Similarly printf last name percentage s studentlastname Finally system pause return zero Lets try and run this program Compile turn on the warnings run enter your first name Im going to say hello enter your last name Im going to say world first name hello last name world So of course for this example we did not require a structure We could have just had two different variables called charfname and charlname and stored it But once weve made it into a structure its very easy for us to understand when we look at the variable student we know were going to store the name of a student And the name of a student comes of two parts which is a first name and a last name So now your program becomes a lot more structured and is very easy to represent complex data like this So now were going to talk about structure padding due to which the size of a particular structure can be more than just the sum of its members Now we shall see why One of the main issues is many processors expect the memory allocated for a particular variable to be byte aligned What I mean by byte aligned is that lets say a variable takes up four bytes like an integer Then the processor expects that variable to sit at a four byte boundary So which means that variable can sit at the byte number 5004 or 5008 or 5012 and so on It cannot be assigned the address 5003 or 5002 because thats not four byte aligned But a character which is one byte can sit anywhere in memory Similarly a double which may be eight bytes would have to be eight byte aligned So now lets see how this property is going to affect the size of our structure So lets say this is my memory And I want to store char ch Because a character takes up just one byte I can store it anywhere in memory So I can store ch at the address 5001 Now lets say I want int num Integer takes up four bytes So I need four bytes in memory The starting address for this four bytes has to be four byte aligned So this has to be either 5004 5008 or a multiple of four So now what happens when we apply the same rule to a structure When the individual variables are no problems integer takes up four bytes It doesnt matter where memory is going to sit I need the address whenever I want it But it can sit anywhere in memory and its going to assign four bytes to it Now lets try to put these two fields within a structure So if I say struct dummy So I have a structure dummy And I have two variables one of the type char and other of the type int So now when I say struct dummy d1 what happens Im going to first erase this So when we declare a structure the space for the structure and the space for all the members within a structure I allocate it one after the other So normally what you would end up doing is in d1 you start d1 here lets say Our character is one byte and integer is four bytes So we need five bytes So allocate to five bytes So d1ch is the first byte And then d1num is the next four bytes So d1 starts here ch or chasch is the first member thats stored here Then num or int num is the second member that is stored here Its simple right So we have three members the third member here fourth member and so on But now lets say if d1ch was at address 5000 ch is the type chasch it can sit anywhere in memory thats okay Which would mean d1num would start at address 5001 But num being an integer it cannot start at address 5001 Like I said earlier it has to be four byte aligned That means after 5000 the next byte it can sit at is 5004 So this is 5004 This is 5001 this is 5002 this is 5003 this is 5004 So you have 5004 here So your d1num has to start at 5004 and then it will occupy four bytes after this point So you have 5005 6007 So d1num is going to occupy these four bytes And d1ch is occupying this byte So what happens to these three bytes These three bytes are wasted And the compiler uses these three bytes to pad the structure so that all the other members are byte aligned So this is called structure padding So now the size of the structure is not 4 plus 1 5 but its 4 plus 1 plus 3 Thats eight bytes So size of the entire structure is eight bytes Knowing such information is useful to us because once we know about structure padding its easier for us to redesign or rewrite the structure so that we use up less space Now instead of writing it like this if youd written the structure as struct dummy int num first and then charsiech So first it will allocate space for the integer num So it can start anywhere in memory right now It will align to four bytes of course So it will allocate space for the integer num which is four bytes And then it will allocate space for charsiech For a character which is one byte it doesnt matter We can start it anywhere This will be ch This will be num So this is four bytes and this is one byte totally eight bytes But then in this case too instead of five bytes the structure is going to take up eight bytes This is because after the charsiech the last three bytes are also going to be used up This is because the entire structure or the end of the structure is also padded based on the size of the largest member The size of the largest member here is four bytes which is for num So the end of the structure also has to be four byte aligned So now once we have a character we still have to assign three more bytes to make it four byte aligned So its going to pad three more bytes making the entire structure eight bytes So in this case which is two variables no matter how we interchange the order the size is going to occupy will remain the same But in a lot of other cases once we are aware of structure padding we can rearrange the members to minimize the effect of structure padding The simplest thing to do to minimize the effect of structure padding is to arrange the members in descending order So lets say I have int num double x and then float f Lets say what happens This is four bytes then this is eight bytes Youre going to use a four bytes for padding Then this is four bytes So weve taken up four bytes We dont have to bother about padding So youve taken up four four eight 16 20 And the end of the structure has all should also be eight byte aligned because the largest member is eight bytes So youre going to have again the four bytes of padding So lets say we had stored the members in the opposite order or a different order So I first stored double double x then I have a float f and int Now now lets see what happens Double x takes up eight bytes and the float f four bytes No padding required because in a four byte boundary int num four bytes Again its in a four byte boundary Total 12 16 Total is 16 bytes So no padding required at the end of the structure either Here the total was four four eight 16 20 24 Weve saved about eight bytes by just rearranging the members Lets just write a program to see if youre right about this Say hash include stdioh We have struct dummy Were going to have int num double x float f int main I just print the size of the structure So print f size percentage d size of struct dummy Find the system pause return zero Lets compile and run this program No errors or warnings Run As we had guessed its 24 bytes Slash n here Now lets have another structure Struct dummy one Here were going to rearrange Were going to have double x int num float f And lets print both the values First we print for dummy and then we say size of struct dummy one There you go 24 and 16 So in this example too you can see struct dummy you have a cache ch it will take a one byte Then you have an integer So between these two youre going to have three bytes of padding And then finally you have a double temp No padding required here because this is already taken up eight bytes So this is going to be at an eighth byte boundary So youre going to take up 8 plus 4 12 12 plus 4 16 So this is going to take up 16 bytes\n",

            "Reference summary for testing sample 678: 66 days of data thats what Im gonna talk about yeah StatQuest Hello Im Josh Starmor and welcome to StatQuest Today were gonna talk about Kenjis 66 days of data challenge and its gonna be clearly explained Every now and then when Im on Twitter or LinkedIn I see something like this Herman says its day 44 and they ate a lot of nachos and they watched my StatQuest on PCA Bam Hashtag 66 days of data and Im like what the heck is this hashtag 66 days of data thing and who is this Kenji person and where can I get some nachos So I called Kenji on the zoom and it turns out that 66 days of data with Kenji is totally awesome Heres the clip What is 66 days of data Well so 66 days of data is initiative that I started I guess its a little more than a year ago and the the big idea is that for 66 days you want to spend at least five minutes each day learning some data science and then you want to share what you learn each day on your platform of choice So it could be just texting one of your friends it could be on the discord community thats been created that has over 6000 members it could be on Twitter it could be on LinkedIn it could be on Facebook it doesnt matter The idea is that youre getting into the habit of learning and then sharing your work and that has a couple benefits So the learning process and creating a habit around that is in my mind the most important one is you know data science is this field where were never going to be done learning Theres always more to learn theres always more information to accumulate So rather than focusing on hey I have to learn this xyz information now I actually think when youre starting out its more important to focus on how you learn that information and creating a habit around that learning process and you know something for me that Ive always struggled with has been a little bit of motivation and one great way to circumvent the need for motivation is creating habits Another way to do that is through accountability So when youre putting your work out there when youre sharing it everyone who knows youre doing the challenge in the community in your Twitter or whatever it is theyre going to be able to hold you accountable and that little extra social pressure to keep you going is something that I think is really valuable to be able to get past that initial learning hump where it can be really scary Cool cool I love it So heres a question Whats your favorite thing about the 66 days challenge Honestly that is the easiest question you could have asked because by far it is the community I would have never guessed we would have gotten so many people involved so many people asking questions so many admins willing to help out so many different viewpoints and so many different individuals that are willing to help out and pitch in and make this community just better What do most people do So theres a couple different routes and I dont think any one route is correct I will say that I think projectbased learning is more effective for me and it also makes what you share a little bit more interesting to everyone else I see that engagement with posts where people are building something is significantly higher than just talking about the concept they learned or the certificate theyre working on but theres a couple different routes So the first that I see very commonly is people use this as a great excuse to start a certificate course or online course The other approach is the projectbased approach where it does take a little bit more planning to say hey these are the projects I want to work on Its also a little bit difficult to time scope a data science project to begin with So people are like oh Im going to do these three projects and they eventually end up just doing one I would also say that a third route this is usually more advanced data scientists who already have a portfolio Theyre using it to go back and review the math or the theory I think thats something that I encourage is that after youve applied these things after youve built stuff I always like to go back and review the theory review the math because now I have something to stick it onto So I think that its kind of choose your own adventure here but based on the stage of your career or the stage of your learning it might make more sense to use this to just focus on the areas where you would like to improve most Again it is your ocean You can choose to study whatever youd like Bam Note starting July 1st 2021 I will be participating in 66 Days of Data with Ken G on Twitter and so should you Ill be using the 66 Days of Data hashtag to say what Ive learned about light GBM Cat Boost natural language processing feature engineering and a bunch of other cool stuff Obviously you can do whatever you want but if you need ideas Ive made a special 66 Days of Data playlist just for you The link is in the description below Double bam In summary the 66 Days of Data with Ken G is any 66 consecutive days that you promise to spend at least 5 minutes doing something related to data that will help you grow personally or professionally You then share what you learned with hashtag 66 Days of Data on the social media platform of your choice like Twitter LinkedIn or the 66 Days of Data Discord server Triple bam Hooray Weve made it to the end of another exciting StackQuest If you like this StackQuest and want to see more please subscribe And if you want to support StackQuest consider contributing to my Patreon campaign becoming a channel member buying one or two of my original songs or a tshirt or a hoodie or just donate The links are in the description below Alright until next time quest on\n"

tutorial and a zombie came and killed me So Im going to respawn It takes me back to the bed that I made that is your respawn point and you notice E for inventory that I have nothing So I am going to go find my stuff I have to leave my bed my temporary shelter Oh look at that Theres a skeleton down there that wants to kill me And I need to figure out where the heck I died Not that I remember Hopefully I wasnt too far from There it is This is where I died I see all of my stuff thrown all over the ground and I basically just have to walk over top of it and pick it up Maybe some fell in the water Oh look at that Its a zombie Awesome Lets see if maybe this chicken wants to come out of the water Itll drown Anyway Im just picking up all of my stuff Picking up all my stuff E for inventory Now its all randomly in here So I need to Where is my sword I didnt get all of my stuff Lets see what else When you die you might not get all of your stuff back If you fall in lava you will get none of your stuff back And if you dont go get it right away it will be too late to get your stuff Where my sword is Ill go make another one All right So Im just heading back over here to my Oh there it is Thats why I have those lights Here is where my crafting table is Right click on the crafting table and Im just going to make a new stone sword So now I have a sword Its good enough Looks to me like I have some wheat So Im heading over to my garden Im going to right Whoops Planted a tree Im going to left click to break up what I just planted Seeds fell in the water E for inventory Im going to put my seeds down in my hot bar Put my seeds in my hand and right click Plant some more seeds Back up Heres my hoe Ho some more dirt Plant some more seeds E for inventory And check that out I have some wheat I really only need one One is great And this should attract sheep and cows for me So Im just going to kind of wander around See if I can accidentally Now that was a spider Its not attacking Well now its going to attack me Kind of bumped it or something Usually during the day the spiders are Oh shoot There is a creeper And its going to want to blow me up Yes I see you Come here Come blow me up Now I try to back up when it blows up so it doesnt kill me kill me It just does a little damage Picking up all this stuff it blew up Cool Now Im going to put this wheat in my hand Now you see my hearts at the bottom are diminished I took some damage from the creeper And again if I was really close to the creeper it would have just killed me straight out So I had a little bit of buffer If I am not hungry it will automatically refill my life If I am hungry it will not refill my life So you would need to eat some food Its starting to get dark Alright I guess I What happened to all these sheep that were hanging around Theres a cow up there It should be very excited about my wheat It is Its very excited about my wheat Oh look at that Chicken wandered into my Uh oh And theres a zombie who would like to have me for dinner And its coming in So now Im going to switch to my sword And now I want to get a cow in here And I need to get out of here Because there will be more zombies coming and I dont want to fight them Im going to go back to my shelter If I double tap the W I can run Ahhhh Back to my shelter That skeleton is going to want to come get me Right click open my door Ahhhh Right click close my door And hopefully I can go to bed because if theres monsters nearby it has Yep thats what it says I cannot rest There are monsters nearby So my choice is to just wait it out Or go fight the monsters so they go away Or I can like break up my bed and Im going to move it farther away And see if maybe I can right click place the bed Make sure I have enough head room There we go I can sleep down here And maybe wait a little bit for it to be daytime for enough time For the zombies and things to not be trying to come get me Nope theyre trying to come get me Okay and my wheat Because my goal here was to get some sheep I have a cow So thats cool Dang it theres a creeper And there he is and Im backing up No Hes going to make my sheep explode And theyre Dang it lost the sheep Thats interesting Okay lets see if I can find another sheep In the meantime Im just kind of break up grass trying to gather some seeds Oh theres a sheep Im going to get near it with my wheat in my hand Come here sheep Okay And Im going to come over here The sheep is going to follow me And Im just going to put it in my pen in here Okay and Im going to stop holding the wheat so I can get out of the gate And repeat\",\n          \"Hey guys today were gonna look at the Vuejs 2 complete guide So Im gonna go over it and were gonna see the good things about it And by the way I put a link below to that course so stay tuned all the way to the end and find out what its all about Alright so if you guys arent familiar with Udemy you can go to udemycom They sell some amazing courses and by the way they have a sale going on right now for 1099 You can get any one of their courses So I thought this week Im gonna go ahead and just do some reviews on some of my favorite courses I put a link below with the link to the courses If you go ahead and buy any of the courses through those links I get a couple bucks It helps the channel so thank you if you do that So when I search for Vuejs there is three different courses that come up that are kind of the most popular ones out there on Udemy And thats the Vuejs 2 the complete guide Vuejs 2 the mastering web apps and the ultimate Vuejs 2 developers course Now today Im not gonna go over David Katzs the Vuejs 2 mastering web apps or the ultimate Vuejs 2 developers course Maybe in the future Ill look at that I know Anthony Gore makes some pretty good courses too but I havent taken his So lets take a look at Max Amillians Schwarzmuller And if you dont know Max is also a YouTuber He has a YouTube channel where he does different tutorials and Vuejs and other technologies And he has this course And I think hes one of the first people to create one of these Vuejs 2 courses So lets take a look a little bit about it And you can see here theres 375 lectures Theres already 34000 students involved in it Its 21 hours of content So you definitely get a jampacked amount of content with this course And of course every time you buy a Udemy course you get a lifetime access on it And you know theres tons of good information tons of reviews on it And he says that he knows how to teach splits every detail into smaller parts and makes another video for each part For this reason you dont feel yourself boring while watching videos Because lots of them are 2 minutes not more No matter what metric you look at Vuejs is the shooting star in the world of JavaScript framework So that is true Vuejs is becoming extremely popular So yeah it definitely covers all the basics And were going to go and look at the curriculum or the course content I cant actually show you the videos unfortunately but I can kind of give you an idea of the different course content And I can explain it Ive watched a bunch of it I havent watched every single thing on it but I think I have a pretty good idea of what its all about So definitely directives filters and mixins And then it kind of gives you here are the types of students that love this course Who have some JavaScript experience that have come over from Angular 2 or Reactjs So the requirements basic Java knowledge is required ES6 knowledge is a plus So this is kind of nice He put a little bit more information in there of who can take this course Really if you have a little bit of JavaScript knowledge I think youre probably okay When I watched it he goes over a lot of the concepts Of course if you dont have any JavaScript knowledge you may want to take a look at it below I put a link to Colt Steels course below That might be the complete web developers boot camp That might be a better choice for you if you completely knew If you have some knowledge or youre coming from React or Angular or youve dipped your toe in the JavaScript world and you want to start off with a new framework I mean this was a great one to start with Its really easy to get started up and running in Vuejs And by the way Ill add one more plug My book The Vuejs in Action its in early access You guys can buy it today If you rather watch something or read something I guess it depends on what you like If you want to get kind of really indepth examples on a lot of different things the first seven chapters are out By the time you watch this I might have eight or nine out Well see But you can just have a link below to where you can get the book And by the way you can get the first three chapters two or three chapters for free Actually the first chapter is definitely for free If you click on the link below you can get that free chapter So you can kind of take a look to see if you like it So of course the target audience is for anyone interested in frontend development And I can never pronounce Maximillians I think Maximillian Schmorsmuller Im not very good at it So he actually has a slight accent If youre from the United States I have an accent of course If youre outside the United States youll notice he does have a little bit of an accent But of course he explains topics really well I mean theres no problem there I can understand it very very well He says he stopped learning new program languages He started learning at age 13 so hes been doing this for a while So thats a little bit about the overview Course content This is obviously the meat of the application of the course that is So he has a getstarting getstarted This is really just how to set up Vue locally kind of the basics you expect in any sort of course And then he goes into interacting with the DOM Most tutorials in Vuejs kind of have this flow right here They always go interacting with the DOM Like how do you deal with a Vue instance How do you raw output HTML The double brackets binding things like that Twoway data binding I kind of skim through a lot of this dynamic styling This is all really good stuff And then V4 Vf the directives Thats where he goes into next This is real good Now Ill have to say he does kind of interlay in different courses Inside the course he puts different projects which I really like I like my tutorials where I have lots of information and then some way to tie it all in So its just not kind of that boring Heres Vf directive heres this How can we tie it into a bigger kind of something a little bit bigger maybe a little more real world So this is his first course project the Monster Slayer So it kind of goes over some of the concepts so thats perfect And then he kind of goes back into the Vue instance It gets a little bit more technical how to update the DOM Then really a lot of courses and I did this too with my book is you start with kind of the basics using Vue as a CDN Youre importing it into your HTML files But really the way that most modern Vue apps are created is with Webpack and Vue CLI because it gives you access to something called single file components which he goes over these vue files which makes creating your Vue applications much easier because you really want to be able to build your application to a bunch of different components And if youre not if you just bring it in through an HTML and the CDN its a little more difficult And you also get some other kind of nice things with it with Scope CSS and a few other things So its definitely well worth it And he looks like he you know he covers it pretty well in this Vue pack CLI Then he goes deep dives into components This is kind of smart because you can do definitely definitely before you learn about Vue pack Webpack and Vue CLI you can do components I kind of wish he would have taught a little bit more of that before this section but its it works either way So he talks about it here the root component better folder structures Definitely talking about props how to pass things in between different components This is a really fundamental feature of Vue Its youre kind of having all these building blocks these components you definitely need to talk to them And it kind of dovetails nicely into Vue X which he talks about later But you could talk about props the event bus which is a little bit more sophisticated way to move information between Vue It does have a little bit of advanced components Slots is a way you can kind of put information in there And then he has another course So like I said hes really good about this He shows a lot of these different concepts and then he ties it back into a course or an actual project which I think makes it all solidify a lot easier I mean its not the greatest Its just kind of a simple app but I think it kind of helps bring all these concepts together I know some courses the projects are pretty much the whole course Like you have a project and then you bring in the different things I guess it just depends on your teaching style I kind of prefer if its more course more projects than than the not And then user input directives like creating custom directives So these these are a little bit more advanced You could definitely taught these a little bit earlier I think in the course But I mean theyre fine where they are Animations transitions Now I thought this interesting Now he does teach view resource which is not on the official recommendation list anymore for VJS It was kind of not recommended by Avenue He created a blog post about that a while ago and Im pretty sure this course was before that So I would just skip this whole V resource I mean this would not I would not use it I mean you can still use it but I would just skip it because its not really officially recommended I mean it still works but theres Axios and some other libraries that work just as well And he actually goes into that later So routing is pretty important here It goes into a lot of different writing examples And then this is probably the best section I think of his whole of the whole course is view X because you can be a very complicated subject and he does definitely break it down I just did a video on view X a little bit earlier this year and I kind of did that same approach Just try to I actually even did more I tried to take everything he taught in like three hours and I condensed it to about 10 minutes So just really the basics of using view X And its a lot It can be a lot easier than than it looks like This goes into excruciating detail now and even goes in at the end He starts doing like separating into different modules and auto namespacing and all that which is interesting And then he ties it into the shock trader which is probably you could probably start here and learn everything all the concepts This is probably the best project he has in the whole inside the whole course And it looks like at the end he has these bonus sections and I think that he just added these later because just kind of pad up the well actually Well in the case this this one the V resource V resources is kind of going kind of not officially recommended anymore So he did an axial section By the way this deploying section is pretty sparse I dont think youre going to get much out of this deploy section if I had one little criticism of it But its nice Its nice Its in here and authentication view apps I really like this He even goes into guards which is kind of protected routes off guards Its really the great the way you want to do authentication Thats kind of a common question I always hear too when people are learning these single page application frameworks Like how do you do authentication You know how do we how do we do that And this this goes over it This is this is a pretty good way of doing it And he uses Firebase in the back end I actually my book I use Firebase to Its just a real easy way of of demonstrating how to do these type of things without having to create your whole back end and muddle everything up And then he I guess he added form input and validation So he adds this and another like plug in And I didnt see anywhere through here Theres a couple other things like view to fi which is pretty popular I didnt see anything on view to fi here anywhere So thats kind of a real popular library Its kind of like bootstrap you can use for the view world But I mean overall I mean its an excellent course So I was really impressed by it I mean Maximilian he goes over it very well You know I would highly recommend this course to anyone thats want to jump into view and get your feet wet on it And Im really interesting Maybe later Ill go back and Ill look at some of the other VJS two courses and let you know kind of what my feelings are Like I said I know Anthony Gores is pretty good too But yeah so if you like this this review can I go ahead and just pay for it Just click on that link below I get a couple of bucks if you buy any courses through it And I would buy its on sale now for like eleven bucks for twenty two hours Its not a bad deal So thanks everybody Leave a comment below Let me know what you guys think of this course Id be interested to hear Thanks\",\n          \"Im drawing a graph Doesnt it look cool But I didnt know how it worked until I watched StackQuest Hello and welcome to StackQuest StackQuest is brought to you by the friendly folks in the genetics department at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Today were going to be talking about TSNE or TISNE To be honest I dont actually know how its pronounced but its going to be clearly explained I know that bet Also this StackQuest is by request A couple of people put it in the comments below and I got a couple of emails from other people so Im doing it because you guys want it Here it goes If youre watching this StackQuest chances are youve seen an example of a TSNE graph before What TSNE does is it takes a high dimensional data set and reduces it to a low dimensional graph that retains a lot of the original information If youre not familiar with those terms of taking a high dimensional data set and reducing it to a low dimensional graph you might want to watch the StackQuest for PCA because I explain what that means in that video Heres a basic 2D scatter plot Lets do a walkthrough of how TSNE would transform this graph into a flat one dimensional plot on a number line Im going to use this super simple example to explain the concepts behind TSNE so that when you see it applied to a much larger data set a much more complex data set youll still know how that graph was drawn Note if we just projected the data onto one of the axes we just get a big mess that doesnt preserve the original clustering If we projected onto the yaxis instead of two distinct clusters we just see a mishmash And the same thing happens if we just project the data onto the xaxis What TSNE does is find a way to project data into a low dimensional space in this case the one dimensional number line so that the clustering in the high dimensional space in this case the two dimensional scatter plot is preserved So lets step through the basic ideas of how TSNE does this Well start with the original scatter plot Then well put the points on the number line in a random order From here on out TSNE moves these points a little bit at a time until it has clustered them Lets figure out where to move this first point Should it move a little to the left or a little to the right Because it is part of this cluster in the two dimensional scatter plot it wants to move closer to these points But at the same time these points are far away in the scatter plot so they push back These points attract while these points repel In this case the attraction is strongest so the point moves a little to the right Bam Now lets move this point a little bit These points attract because they are close to each other in the two dimensional scatter plot And this point repels a little bit because it is far from the point in the two dimensional scatter plot So it moves a little closer to the other orange points Double bam At each step a point on the line is attracted to points it is near in the scatter plot and repelled by points it is far from Triple bam Now that weve seen what TSNE tries to do lets dive into the nitty gritty details of how it does what it does Step 1 determine the similarity of all the points in the scatter plot For this example lets focus on determining the similarities between this point and all of the other points First measure the distance between two points Then plot that distance on a normal curve that is centered on the point of interest Lastly draw a line from the point to the curve The length of that line is the unscaled similarity I made that terminology up but it will make sense in just a bit so hold on Now we calculate the unscaled similarity for this pair of points Now we calculate the unscaled similarity for this pair of points And now we calculate the unscaled similarity for this pair of points Etc etc etc Using a normal distribution means that distant points have very low similarity values and close points have high similarity values Ultimately we measure the distances between all of the points and the point of interest Then plot them on a normal curve And then measure the distances from the points to the curve to get the unscaled similarity scores with respect to the point of interest The next step is to scale the unscaled similarities so that they add up to 1 Ummm why do the similarity scores need to add up to 1 It has to do with something I didnt tell you earlier And to illustrate the concept I need to add a cluster that is half as dense as the others The width of the normal curve depends on the density of data near the point of interest Less dense regions have wider curves So if these points have half the density as these points and this curve is half as wide as this curve then scaling the similarity scores will make them the same for both clusters Heres an example where Ive worked out the math This curve has a standard deviation equal to 1 These are the unscaled similarity values This curve has a standard deviation equal to 2 These points are twice as far from the middle The unscaled similarity values are half of the other ones To scale the similarity scores so that they sum to 1 you take a score and you divide it by the sum of all the scores That equals the scaled score Heres how the math works out when the distribution has a standard deviation equals to 1 We get 082 and 018 as the scaled similarity scores And heres the math for when everything is spread out twice as much We get 082 and 018 The similarity scores on top are equal to the similarity scores below Theyre the same That implies that the scaled similarity scores for this relatively tight cluster are the same for this relatively loose cluster The reality is a little more complicated but only slightly TSNE has a perplexity parameter equal to the expected density around each point And that comes into play but these clusters are still more similar than you might expect Now back to the original scatter plot Weve calculated similarity scores for this point Now we do it for this point And we do it for all the points One last thing and the scatter plot will be all set with similarity scores Because the width of the distribution is based on the density of the surrounding data points the similarity score for this node might not be the same as the similarity to this node So TSNE just averages the two similarity scores from the two directions No big deal Ultimately you end up with a matrix of similarity scores Each row and column represents the similarity scores calculated from that point of interest Red equals high similarity and white equals low similarity Ive drawn the similarity from a point of interest to itself as dark red However it doesnt really make sense to say that a point is similar to itself because that doesnt help the clustering So TSNE actually defines that similarity as zero Hooray Were done calculating similarity scores for the scatter plot Now we randomly project the data onto the number line and calculate similarity scores for the points on the number line Just like before that means picking a point measuring a distance and lastly drawing a line from the point to a curve However this time were using a Tdistribution A Tdistribution is a lot like a normal distribution except the T isnt as tall in the middle and the tails are taller on the ends The Tdistribution is the T in TSNE Well talk about why the Tdistribution is used in a little bit So using a Tdistribution we calculate unscaled similarity scores for all the points and then scale them like before Like before we end up with a matrix of similarity scores but this matrix is a mess compared to the original matrix The goal of moving this point is we want to make this row look like this row TSNE moves the points a little bit at a time and at each step it chooses a direction that makes the matrix on the left more like the matrix on the right It uses small steps because its a little bit like a chess game and cant be solved all at once Instead it goes one move at a time Bam Now to finally tell you why the Tdistribution is used Without it the clusters would all clump up in the middle and be harder to see Triple bam And now we know how TSNE works Ive used a really simple example here but the concepts are the exact same for more complicated datasets Hooray Weve made it to the end of another exciting StatQuest If you like this StatQuest and want to see more like it please subscribe And if you have any ideas for future StatQuests just put them in the comments below Until next time quest on\"\n        ],\n

you want to start off with a new framework I mean this was a great one to start with Its really easy to get started up and running in Vuejs And by the way Ill add one more plug My book The Vuejs in Action its in early access You guys can buy it today If you rather watch something or read something I guess it depends on what you like If you want to get kind of really indepth examples on a lot of different things the first seven chapters are out By the time you watch this I might have eight or nine out Well see But you can just have a link below to where you can get the book And by the way you can get the first three chapters two or three chapters for free Actually the first chapter is definitely for free If you click on the link below you can get that free chapter So you can kind of take a look to see if you like it So of course the target audience is for anyone interested in frontend development And I can never pronounce Maximillians I think Maximillian Schmorsmuller Im not very good at it So he actually has a slight accent If youre from the United States I have an accent of course If youre outside the United States youll notice he does have a little bit of an accent But of course he explains topics really well I mean theres no problem there I can understand it very very well He says he stopped learning new program languages He started learning at age 13 so hes been doing this for a while So thats a little bit about the overview Course content This is obviously the meat of the application of the course that is So he has a getstarting getstarted This is really just how to set up Vue locally kind of the basics you expect in any sort of course And then he goes into interacting with the DOM Most tutorials in Vuejs kind of have this flow right here They always go interacting with the DOM Like how do you deal with a Vue instance How do you raw output HTML The double brackets binding things like that Twoway data binding I kind of skim through a lot of this dynamic styling This is all really good stuff And then V4 Vf the directives Thats where he goes into next This is real good Now Ill have to say he does kind of interlay in different courses Inside the course he puts different projects which I really like I like my tutorials where I have lots of information and then some way to tie it all in So its just not kind of that boring Heres Vf directive heres this How can we tie it into a bigger kind of something a little bit bigger maybe a little more real world So this is his first course project the Monster Slayer So it kind of goes over some of the concepts so thats perfect And then he kind of goes back into the Vue instance It gets a little bit more technical how to update the DOM Then really a lot of courses and I did this too with my book is you start with kind of the basics using Vue as a CDN Youre importing it into your HTML files But really the way that most modern Vue apps are created is with Webpack and Vue CLI because it gives you access to something called single file components which he goes over these vue files which makes creating your Vue applications much easier because you really want to be able to build your application to a bunch of different components And if youre not if you just bring it in through an HTML and the CDN its a little more difficult And you also get some other kind of nice things with it with Scope CSS and a few other things So its definitely well worth it And he looks like he you know he covers it pretty well in this Vue pack CLI Then he goes deep dives into components This is kind of smart because you can do definitely definitely before you learn about Vue pack Webpack and Vue CLI you can do components I kind of wish he would have taught a little bit more of that before this section but its it works either way So he talks about it here the root component better folder structures Definitely talking about props how to pass things in between different components This is a really fundamental feature of Vue Its youre kind of having all these building blocks these components you definitely need to talk to them And it kind of dovetails nicely into Vue X which he talks about later But you could talk about props the event bus which is a little bit more sophisticated way to move information between Vue It does have a little bit of advanced components Slots is a way you can kind of put information in there And then he has another course So like I said hes really good about this He shows a lot of these different concepts and then he ties it back into a course or an actual project which I think makes it all solidify a lot easier I mean its not the greatest Its just kind of a simple app but I think it kind of helps bring all these concepts together I know some courses the projects are pretty much the whole course Like you have a project and then you bring in the different things I guess it just depends on your teaching style I kind of prefer if its more course more projects than than the not And then user input directives like creating custom directives So these these are a little bit more advanced You could definitely taught these a little bit earlier I think in the course But I mean theyre fine where they are Animations transitions Now I thought this interesting Now he does teach view resource which is not on the official recommendation list anymore for VJS It was kind of not recommended by Avenue He created a blog post about that a while ago and Im pretty sure this course was before that So I would just skip this whole V resource I mean this would not I would not use it I mean you can still use it but I would just skip it because its not really officially recommended I mean it still works but theres Axios and some other libraries that work just as well And he actually goes into that later So routing is pretty important here It goes into a lot of different writing examples And then this is probably the best section I think of his whole of the whole course is view X because you can be a very complicated subject and he does definitely break it down I just did a video on view X a little bit earlier this year and I kind of did that same approach Just try to I actually even did more I tried to take everything he taught in like three hours and I condensed it to about 10 minutes So just really the basics of using view X And its a lot It can be a lot easier than than it looks like This goes into excruciating detail now and even goes in at the end He starts doing like separating into different modules and auto namespacing and all that which is interesting And then he ties it into the shock trader which is probably you could probably start here and learn everything all the concepts This is probably the best project he has in the whole inside the whole course And it looks like at the end he has these bonus sections and I think that he just added these later because just kind of pad up the well actually Well in the case this this one the V resource V resources is kind of going kind of not officially recommended anymore So he did an axial section By the way this deploying section is pretty sparse I dont think youre going to get much out of this deploy section if I had one little criticism of it But its nice Its nice Its in here and authentication view apps I really like this He even goes into guards which is kind of protected routes off guards Its really the great the way you want to do authentication Thats kind of a common question I always hear too when people are learning these single page application frameworks Like how do you do authentication You know how do we how do we do that And this this goes over it This is this is a pretty good way of doing it And he uses Firebase in the back end I actually my book I use Firebase to Its just a real easy way of of demonstrating how to do these type of things without having to create your whole back end and muddle everything up And then he I guess he added form input and validation So he adds this and another like plug in And I didnt see anywhere through here Theres a couple other things like view to fi which is pretty popular I didnt see anything on view to fi here anywhere So thats kind of a real popular library Its kind of like bootstrap you can use for the view world But I mean overall I mean its an excellent course So I was really impressed by it I mean Maximilian he goes over it very well You know I would highly recommend this course to anyone thats want to jump into view and get your feet wet on it And Im really interesting Maybe later Ill go back and Ill look at some of the other VJS two courses and let you know kind of what my feelings are Like I said I know Anthony Gores is pretty good too But yeah so if you like this this review can I go ahead and just pay for it Just click on that link below I get a couple of bucks if you buy any courses through it And I would buy its on sale now for like eleven bucks for twenty two hours Its not a bad deal So thanks everybody Leave a comment below Let me know what you guys think of this course Id be interested to hear Thanks\",\n          \"Im drawing a graph Doesnt it look cool But I didnt know how it worked until I watched StackQuest Hello and welcome to StackQuest StackQuest is brought to you by the friendly folks in the genetics department at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Today were going to be talking about TSNE or TISNE To be honest I dont actually know how its pronounced but its going to be clearly explained I know that bet Also this StackQuest is by request A couple of people put it in the comments below and I got a couple of emails from other people so Im doing it because you guys want it Here it goes If youre watching this StackQuest chances are youve seen an example of a TSNE graph before What TSNE does is it takes a high dimensional data set and reduces it to a low dimensional graph that retains a lot of the original information If youre not familiar with those terms of taking a high dimensional data set and reducing it to a low dimensional graph you might want to watch the StackQuest for PCA because I explain what that means in that video Heres a basic 2D scatter plot Lets do a walkthrough of how TSNE would transform this graph into a flat one dimensional plot on a number line Im going to use this super simple example to explain the concepts behind TSNE so that when you see it applied to a much larger data set a much more complex data set youll still know how that graph was drawn Note if we just projected the data onto one of the axes we just get a big mess that doesnt preserve the original clustering If we projected onto the yaxis instead of two distinct clusters we just see a mishmash And the same thing happens if we just project the data onto the xaxis What TSNE does is find a way to project data into a low dimensional space in this case the one dimensional number line so that the clustering in the high dimensional space in this case the two dimensional scatter plot is preserved So lets step through the basic ideas of how TSNE does this Well start with the original scatter plot Then well put the points on the number line in a random order From here on out TSNE moves these points a little bit at a time until it has clustered them Lets figure out where to move this first point Should it move a little to the left or a little to the right Because it is part of this cluster in the two dimensional scatter plot it wants to move closer to these points But at the same time these points are far away in the scatter plot so they push back These points attract while these points repel In this case the attraction is strongest so the point moves a little to the right Bam Now lets move this point a little bit These points attract because they are close to each other in the two dimensional scatter plot And this point repels a little bit because it is far from the point in the two dimensional scatter plot So it moves a little closer to the other orange points Double bam At each step a point on the line is attracted to points it is near in the scatter plot and repelled by points it is far from Triple bam Now that weve seen what TSNE tries to do lets dive into the nitty gritty details of how it does what it does Step 1 determine the similarity of all the points in the scatter plot For this example lets focus on determining the similarities between this point and all of the other points First measure the distance between two points Then plot that distance on a normal curve that is centered on the point of interest Lastly draw a line from the point to the curve The length of that line is the unscaled similarity I made that terminology up but it will make sense in just a bit so hold on Now we calculate the unscaled similarity for this pair of points Now we calculate the unscaled similarity for this pair of points And now we calculate the unscaled similarity for this pair of points Etc etc etc Using a normal distribution means that distant points have very low similarity values and close points have high similarity values Ultimately we measure the distances between all of the points and the point of interest Then plot them on a normal curve And then measure the distances from the points to the curve to get the unscaled similarity scores with respect to the point of interest The next step is to scale the unscaled similarities so that they add up to 1 Ummm why do the similarity scores need to add up to 1 It has to do with something I didnt tell you earlier And to illustrate the concept I need to add a cluster that is half as dense as the others The width of the normal curve depends on the density of data near the point of interest Less dense regions have wider curves So if these points have half the density as these points and this curve is half as wide as this curve then scaling the similarity scores will make them the same for both clusters Heres an example where Ive worked out the math This curve has a standard deviation equal to 1 These are the unscaled similarity values This curve has a standard deviation equal to 2 These points are twice as far from the middle The unscaled similarity values are half of the other ones To scale the similarity scores so that they sum to 1 you take a score and you divide it by the sum of all the scores That equals the scaled score Heres how the math works out when the distribution has a standard deviation equals to 1 We get 082 and 018 as the scaled similarity scores And heres the math for when everything is spread out twice as much We get 082 and 018 The similarity scores on top are equal to the similarity scores below Theyre the same That implies that the scaled similarity scores for this relatively tight cluster are the same for this relatively loose cluster The reality is a little more complicated but only slightly TSNE has a perplexity parameter equal to the expected density around each point And that comes into play but these clusters are still more similar than you might expect Now back to the original scatter plot Weve calculated similarity scores for this point Now we do it for this point And we do it for all the points One last thing and the scatter plot will be all set with similarity scores Because the width of the distribution is based on the density of the surrounding data points the similarity score for this node might not be the same as the similarity to this node So TSNE just averages the two similarity scores from the two directions No big deal Ultimately you end up with a matrix of similarity scores Each row and column represents the similarity scores calculated from that point of interest Red equals high similarity and white equals low similarity Ive drawn the similarity from a point of interest to itself as dark red However it doesnt really make sense to say that a point is similar to itself because that doesnt help the clustering So TSNE actually defines that similarity as zero Hooray Were done calculating similarity scores for the scatter plot Now we randomly project the data onto the number line and calculate similarity scores for the points on the number line Just like before that means picking a point measuring a distance and lastly drawing a line from the point to a curve However this time were using a Tdistribution A Tdistribution is a lot like a normal distribution except the T isnt as tall in the middle and the tails are taller on the ends The Tdistribution is the T in TSNE Well talk about why the Tdistribution is used in a little bit So using a Tdistribution we calculate unscaled similarity scores for all the points and then scale them like before Like before we end up with a matrix of similarity scores but this matrix is a mess compared to the original matrix The goal of moving this point is we want to make this row look like this row TSNE moves the points a little bit at a time and at each step it chooses a direction that makes the matrix on the left more like the matrix on the right It uses small steps because its a little bit like a chess game and cant be solved all at once Instead it goes one move at a time Bam Now to finally tell you why the Tdistribution is used Without it the clusters would all clump up in the middle and be harder to see Triple bam And now we know how TSNE works Ive used a really simple example here but the concepts are the exact same for more complicated datasets Hooray Weve made it to the end of another exciting StatQuest If you like

            "Reference summary for training sample 778: Alright so in the last lecture we talked about strings We discussed how we can split strings slice strings how strings work and so on And again there are several functions that we can use with strings and well get to them later in the course but basically I just wanted to give you a quick introduction on how swing strings work Now we get on to lists So for example lets say I had to go to maybe Fred Meyer or Target or any shopping store thats maybe near you and I was creating a list So lets create a shopping list of the things I need to buy And Im going to be using a string here So I have a shopping list maybe I need eggs eggs I might need some carrots oh I need milk cherries and lets add one more apples So lets say I had to go to a shopping store and I had all these different items that I had to buy So right now what the problem is is that if I need to know whats the first item in my list what do I have remaining Stuff like that I cant do that with a string Right now if I just want to find out whats my first item Ill have to do shopping list and then use some spicing stuff but that also depends on if I know the number of characters Right now if I just print shopping list Im just going to get egg carrots milk cherries and apples Theres no specific way to find out whats my first item whats my third item whats the last item I have to get And this is where the Python term lists and the more general term arrays comes in So again lets create a new list shopping list 20 or 2 And lets create an array over here And the way to create an array is were going to be using two square brackets And in the square brackets youre now going to add your items So our first item was eggs our second item was carrots third item was milk cherries apples So these lists right theyre the most versatile data type available in Python All the items and the items in the list can be of any data type strings numbers etc but they can be So this is our shopping list in which weve used an array Now for example if I print out shopping list 20 what do I get I get eggs carrots milk cherries apples in square brackets And now youre wondering hey whats the difference in shopping list 20 and shopping list 10 The only difference I can see is that were adding these square brackets Well guys the whole point of arrays is that we can now use indexing to get our values Whenever you create an array and again in arrays you can add any value whatsoever You could have added integers floats you could have added decimal values stuff like that into the array Right now since its a shopping list Ive used strings But the whole point of arrays is theyve given each value an index number So Im at the grocery store and Ive checked mark eggs but Im not sure what is my next item in my list So what we can do now is if we do shopping list 20 and then in square brackets right next to it 20 we get milk So youre probably wondering well why didnt we get carrots Its a second value Well think about it like this Just like we talked about characters in the last lecture with lists its the exact same thing The indexing in a list in a string in almost all data types in Python it starts at zero So the eggs index is zero If I want to know what is my first item in my list Im going to use shopping list 20 and then in square brackets the first item which is zero If I want to find out hey whats my fourth item in my list Im going to say shopping list 20 and then n minus 1 If I want to know the fourth its 4 minus 1 3 So shopping list 30 its cherries So this is where lists become more and more useful And this isnt the end Theres tons of functions you can add with lists Right now all weve done is weve accessed values Lets say I was at the grocery store and Im like wait I dont need milk anymore I realized I have two cartons at home Instead I need chocolate How do I update the value in list Right now if we were using a string there was no way we could do that Wed have to rewrite the string over and over again Waste of time However with lists its quite simple First find the position Whats our position Its going to be 2 So all were going to say here is shopping list 20 should now be equal to chocolate Do you see what we did there What were saying oh string object does not support item assignment Oh the error I was getting here is sorry about that Its shopping list 20 since the variable name was shopping list 20 So here in case I want to change milk to chocolate now typing in chocolate again And if I print out shopping list 20 we get eggs carrots chocolate cherries apples Isnt that cool So you can update values in lists You can change You can delete You can add These lists are the most versatile object youll find in Python And as we get along in the course as we add or dive deeper into Python list will be one of the main objects we use every day So play around with this And in the next lecture Ill be showing you some cool functions that we can use with lists See you then\n",
            "Reference summary for training sample 286: Well hello internet and welcome to part eight of my Python for Finance video tutorial series In the last video I showed you how to create efficient portfolios using the Markowitz portfolio optimization technique And then we looked at the Sharpe ratio What Im going to do in this video is we are going to search the entire market so that we can create the most optimized portfolios to maximize return while minimizing your overall risk Im going to talk again more about the Sharpe ratio And then Im also going to show you how to automatically generate the optimized weighting to create your portfolio so that you know exactly how many shares to buy And I have a lot to do so lets get into it Alright so previously in part four I showed you how to go and find those sector stocks being stocks that fit into certain sectors being technology healthcare financials and all these other different ones and then find those who had the highest ROI Now our job here is to try to create like a super portfolio So what I did was I took the top 30 or more of these different sector stocks plugged them in and I had about 400 different stocks And you can see the tickers and all that And then from that point what I did was I had you know I generated portfolios like I did previously in the last video efficient portfolios that maximize return and minimize risk Well then what I did was in those situations because I want this portfolio to be small I dont want to buy 400 stocks I might as well just go and get an index if I want to do that So what I wanted to do was I got the list of securities And lets say that after I ran the test I had 40 of them Well in situations in which I had stocks that were you know quite a bit under 1 allocation wise I eliminated them And then I ran my tests again to create another efficient portfolio And I did this over and over and over again until I got this core group of stocks that showed great return All right And Im not just going to show you code here Im going to actually write code because what Im going to do after this is after it gives you a recommendation for the securities to purchase and the percentages to purchase Im going to show you or Im going to create a whole bunch of functions that are going to automatically generate how many shares you need to buy to approximate the efficient portfolio Okay So everything else here is exactly the same as the last video here or all of the prices changes for all of our different securities And this is the updated list the brand new list of best of best at least you know based off my calculations And again we have a new plot here with all of our different securities starting at 100 so you can see that growth And all of this code is of course this whole entire file and everything here is on GitHub for free Its in the description So if you want to look at it I help a lot Okay I went and got mean returns just like before covariances to make sure that we have noncorrelated assets in our portfolio And more importantly correlation shows this a lot better So what we want to do is try to get assets that are below 05 in all of these different columns as much as humanly possible And that is going to make our portfolio less risk adverse And here what I did was generate random weights Here is the return of the portfolio There is the volatility of the portfolio You can see here this is when I was generating all those There is the efficient frontier with all those 10000 different portfolios made up of those individual securities And then we applied the Sharpe ratio again just like we did in the last video And from that we were able to generate the key great portfolio that matches closest with this And you can see here we have a 24 volatility and a return of 379 Lets see if we can find that here So 24 and 37 Im guessing it is this guy right here And you can see it is way off of there Okay So that is definitely a very efficient portfolio All right So what are we going to do now Well our goal here now is we know what percentages to buy for each of these securities Well the only problem is every single security isnt priced at the same price Theyre all over the place And what we need to do is we need to come in here and actually figure out how much or how many shares of each of these securities we need to buy to get close to 2472 for example Okay And thats the percentage that we need of the GNRC stock 16 for the next 68 Da da da So what Im going to do is Im going to create a function that is going to do that Now every single time I run this code I get a slightly different portfolio So I decided to use this mixture of securities And what I want to do here is I want to try and get as close as possible buying individual shares of these securities Yes I know you can buy fractional shares but this is something that I a question that was requested of me and Im going to fulfill it Okay So what were going to do here first I want to think about you know like whats going on So PG stock is very close to one So Im just going to say its one All right But as youre going to see my function is going to be its all gone close to being perfect Okay So Im off by 09 Thats not really going to affect the overall risk and return of this portfolio All right So what do we have Well we have 118 This is what our function is going to do Its going to take 118 and because that represents the price for PG stock and its going to multiply it times 22 So times 22 Im explaining the code that Im going to create Now if we do this we get 26004 and then what we want to do is we want to divide that by the value of the GNRC stock which is priced at 10201 Now if we do that what were going to get is an answer of 2549 So that means to approximate based off of Procter and Gamble being 1 and this being almost 22 What we want to do is figure out how many shares of GNRC we need to buy to meet our requirement of getting 22 Well the answer to that is 25 shares And then what we need to do is just simply multiply that times 10201 and whenever we do that that will give us the total amount that we are going to invest in GNRC stock And in situations in which like for example COG or I think Charter causes some problems because of its price In situations in which prices just will not work what Im going to do with our function is Im going to say guarantee we get at least one of those securities And lets see how it works out So Im going to create basically everything you see right here down here in a way that is going to work with an entire portfolio So Im going to call this get port shares like this and this is going to represent the price of the 1 stock So PG stock is going to be passed inside of here and its going to be used as a model right here So were going to get past that value and what else are we going to pass Well do we want to force that we definitely will get at least one share of each security Well they can either make this true or false it is up to them Then were going to get an array of weights that we are trying to aim for and an array of prices Okay so now that we have that Im going to keep this on the board because basically what Im doing is Im modeling this calculation down here in the code Alright so what I want to do first is I want to find out the number of stocks that we are going to be analyzing and to do that I can just go equals length and weights exactly like that Alright then I am going to create a list and its going to hold the number of shares for each of those securities This is going to be an updating list I am then also going to have the costs for those securities also updated and then Im going to say i is equal to and Im going to cycle through the weights and the prices and figure this stuff out So Im going to say while i is less than the number of stocks that we want to analyze well So I want to get the maximum amount to spend on a stock and Im just going to call this max price and thats going to be equal to whatever the value is of the PNG stock that was passed in I think you can see right here how Im basically just modeling this Thats whats going on Then what Im going to do is Im going to get my weighting and that is going to update whoops I dont like that there Times the weights and theyre going to update each time Then what I want to do is get the number of shares to buy and add that to the list So Im going to say the number of shares that I need to buy to be able to get as close as possible to that recommended allocation So to do that Im going to convert this answer into an integer because you cant buy fractions of a share at least in my world and Im going to say that is going to be divided by whatever the price is for that security Now what we can do is we can say if the user wants us to always have at least one security and the number of shares after this calculation is equal to zero Well in that situation Im going to mark the number of shares equal to one So that guarantees we have at least one share of every single security and well see how that works out Then I want to append the number of shares to buy for that security to our shares list and then I want to get the cost of those shares and append that to a list So to do so I go cost is equal to the number of shares times the prices I like that and then Im going to say cost and shares and append that cost to it Okay And then I have to of course increment the value of I to get the next security and then after Im done with that I can return both So Im going to say return the list which is shares that I need to buy and the cost per shares Okay So there we go Got that function Well now what I want to do is I want to get my portfolio waiting So Im going to create another function here and its going to say get port and waiting and Im going to be passing in share cost into that and Im going to create another list and this guy waits like this This is just an empty list thats going to be populated I am going to go and Im going to need to go and get the total sum of all the investments in the portfolio So total and I just call sum on the share cost and itll give me the total sum of all the different stocks in that list and I can come in here and maybe I want to print that information out So Ill say total investment So this is going to say the total investment the user is going to have to make with this portfolio to get this allocation Then all I do is I just say for X in and share cost like that and stock waits and append and what I can append is just X divided by whatever the total value of the portfolio is And then after I do all of that for all those different securities I can say that I want to return the stock waits Now I was going to show you the value of the portfolio by date but Im going to leave that till the next video because it makes more sense then So we have our list of securities right here that we went and condensed down into the core stocks we want to buy and then on top of that I have the weightings that I want for each of those securities Then all I did was I rounded these numbers so 219 became 22 16 became this and so forth and so on So now what were going to do is were going to use our functions that we just created to come in here and see how many shares we need to buy of each of the individual securities to get these percentage weightings Alright so pretty good stuff So what Im going to do is Im going to say that I want to create a starting What I want to do is just get all stock prices on my starting date So Im going to go port df start is equal to merge and data frame by column name which is a function I created forever ago in past videos So adjust it close and Im going to get a specific price All I do is I pass in one date instead of passing in two dates So I have 20 this is the very first trading day of 2021 or 2020 So throw that there and I am going to throw in my portfolio list So that is generating that data frame Then what I need to do is I need to convert from this data frame to a regular old python list So Im going to call this port prices portfolio prices obviously and go port data frame start and then you call values and then you say to list like this and its going to create that list The only problem is is its going to create a list inside of a list We dont want that We just want a list So theres a trick you can just go port prices is equal to some like that and this will convert it into a simple python list You just pass in port prices like that and an empty array and that will give us exactly what we want All right So now what I want to do is I want to go and call get port shares this guy right here Im going to pass in the one price which is going to be the price for PG stock Im going to say yes I want to demand that I get at least one of every single security and then I pass in two arrays One of the arrays is the weights for the securities and the prices for said securities and then its going to provide me the information that I want So I is going to provide whoops the total shares that I need to buy to get my allocation that Im looking for and its also going to provide share cost passed back to me So I just go get port shares like this 118 once again is the value of Procter and Gamble stock that were going to use as a baseline for making predictions about all of our other securities and then were going to pass in our weights and our prices exactly like that Okay so now what do we got We got all our information We just need to test it to see if it matches with what we want percentage wise So if I want to print out the shares that I need to buy of each security to try and get as close as humanly possible to that well thats what thats going to do and then I can also go share cost if I want to print out that as well and I just go share cost like that and what else do we need I am going to go and get a list of the weights for the stock so Ill say stock and weights is equal to get port weighting like this and pass in the share cost like that and then I can go and print this out This will be the weights for all of them so Ill just say stock and weights and then I can go stock weights like this and then if I think thats good Alright so lets just keep that there Lets run it see if it worked Actually I think there was one error in my code that I corrected without thinking and it was right here I accidentally whenever I was showing you I accidentally had a W right there so make sure you put an X right there Okay so now lets test our results So these were the percentages we were aiming at and lets see how close we got with our weightings So we wanted 219 of GNRC stock and we got 217 We wanted 156 we got 159 We wanted 23 we got 238 and as you can see everything is working itself out just about perfectly Okay so there you go guys Now you know how to take a mountain of stock how to combine them analyze them find noncorrelated assets combine them into gigantic high return low risk portfolios and you also know how many shares to buy to get this target allocation of stocks So hopefully you find this beneficial and useful and like always please leave your questions and comments down below otherwise until next time\n",

fire If the fire was hot enough all the materials in these four things would break down into a gaseous mixture of molecules and atoms If you make this fire hotter all the atoms would break down into their component electrons and neutrons If you go hotter still these particles would break down into the fundamental particles of the standard model things like quarks and leptons And if you go even hotter were talking astronomical temperatures around 10 to 31 degrees or about a million trillion trillion degrees Celsius all the quarks and leptons of the four fundamental forces of nature would break down into one entity a kind of soup where all the fundamental particles and the underlying forces responsible for their behavior would meld into one This is what is believed to have existed at the moment of creation at the moment of the Big Bang All the particles and forces of our reality came from this primordial soup But this is the story of the four fundamental forces of the universe that as far as is known control everything in the universe every movement every phenomenon and every process you can possibly think of What is the nature of these forces How do they work And where do they come from Thats coming up right now What is the nature of the four fundamental forces of the universe According to modern particle theory represented by the standard model of particle physics all matter is composed of six quarks and six leptons and their 12 antiparticle pairs But thats not all Matter is subject to four fundamental forces that cause this matter to behave in certain ways and result in essentially every action that you see all around you and everywhere in the universe These four forces are the strong force which binds the nuclei of atoms by holding protons and neutrons together in their center the weak force which is responsible for some kinds of radioactivity electromagnetism responsible for electricity and light and is also the root cause of chemistry and finally gravity which binds us to the earth and keeps the planets in their orbits around the sun Yet the most interesting aspect of this picture is that at a fundamental level scientists believe that all the forces come from one underlying force or principle And astonishingly not only that but according to current understanding all 24 of the different fundamental particles and the four forces are one and the same at some deep level This is the ultimate symmetry of the universe Perhaps the best way to understand this and how these forces emerged is to visualize what happened at the very beginning of time at the Big Bang when everything was one Time began not at zero but at the smallest measurement of time that can be represented by our models of quantum mechanics and that is Planck time This is not zero but pretty close from our perspective 10 to the negative 43 seconds This is not to say that nothing existed prior to this but it is just the limit of our knowledge We are ignorant of anything that might have occurred prior to this first epoch of existence So this is aptly called the Planck epoch All the forces and particles were one and the same in a point smaller than the size of a proton Gravity is thought to have separated from everything else shortly after this time period So it was the first force to separate out from the other three forces The temperatures at this stage of the universe were as you might expect astronomical 10 to the 31 degrees Celsius and the energies were on the range of 10 to the 19 billion electron volts or giga electron volts If we ever develop a theory of everything then it would explain everything that occurred up to this time The strings of string theory and the loops of loop quantum gravity if those theories are correct come into existence and apply here The next era called the Grand Unified Epoch lasts from the first Planck second 10 to the negative 43 seconds to about 10 to the negative 35 seconds Up to this period the remaining three forces the strong force the weak force and electromagnetism were all united But shortly after this period from about 10 to the negative 34 to 10 to the negative 32 seconds the strong force separated from the other two electromagnetism and the weak force which were united as one force called the electroweak force Temperatures were now around 10 to the 26 degrees Celsius and the energy was reduced to 10 to the 15 giga electron volts If we ever discover the Grand Unified Theory or GUT which unites the strong force with the electroweak force we would need to model what happens at these energy levels and temperatures Somehow the separation of the strong force is thought to have resulted or powered something called cosmic inflation This is the momentary expansion of the universe which went from something tinier than the size of a proton to the size of a grapefruit This is a huge increase in size Its analogous to something as small as a tennis ball becoming the size of the solar system in a very small instant At 10 to the negative 12 seconds called the quark epoch the electroweak force split into the weak force and electromagnetism These two now became separate forces So at this point all the four forces became distinct The temperature of the universe cooled to 10 to the 15 degrees Celsius and energies are about 100 giga electron volts We know a lot about the universe up to this era because such energy levels can be easily modeled in particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider So our understanding of the electroweak force is fairly robust The Higgs field also exists at this stage as well How do we know Because about 100 giga electron volts was needed to create the Higgs boson and this can be done at the LHC Now fast forward to today 138 billion years later where the average temperature of the universe is negative 270 degrees Celsius and energy is on the order of 025 electron volts Lets look closer at the four forces and lets start with the two we are most familiar with gravity and electromagnetism They are similar in that their mathematical formulas look nearly identical In the first formula Newtons law of universal gravitation can be expressed as the following where G is Newtons gravitational constant Coulombs law of electrical force between charged bodies can be expressed as the following where K is Coulombs constant The first formula tells us that the gravitational force between any two bodies is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the distance between them squared Notice that the force extends infinitely far This means that the Earth has a gravitational effect on not just the Moon and the other planets of our solar system but also some effect on every other massive object in the universe Mind you this is a very small effect because the R on the equation would be very large for things very far away So the force would be very weak but it is nonzero Since gravity affects anything with mass this effect is the most influential force on a cosmic scale But almost everything I just said also applies to electromagnetism The electrostatic force between charges extends also infinitely far away This means that a charged particle on Earth has a nonzero effect on a charged particle near Proxima Centauri our nearest neighboring star and charged particles everywhere else in the universe And this force is much much greater than the force of gravity In fact the magnitude of electromagnetism is 10 to the 36 times greater than the magnitude of gravity So why isnt electromagnetism the most dominant force in the universe The reason is because on large scales electric charges of large objects tend to cancel each other out Large objects tend to be neutral So since a charged particle can only affect other charged particles this force is mostly nonexistent at large scales If large things were not electrically neutral this force would completely dominate our universe But electromagnetism still has a big influence on our world It is responsible for the nature of light and it is the main force responsible for all the biochemistry taking place in our bodies and the rest of Earth Its the basis of all chemistry So now you have to ask if electromagnetism is so strong then what keeps multiple protons each of which are positively charged bound in the nucleus of atoms According to Coulombs law if you do the calculations the two protons of a helium atom experience a force equal to about 20 pounds For something as small as atoms this is a huge force They should repel each other and fly apart instantly The reason that protons dont fly apart is because they are kept glued together with a force that is even stronger than electromagnetism 100 times stronger And this force is creatively called the strong nuclear force It is the strongest force in the universe However it extends only as far as the width of a proton Remarkably it is very small or nonexistent beyond this length This force has been described as velcro When two protons are really close the force keeps them strongly bound together But when they are further apart in the width of a proton it is about nonexistent This force is not simply the opposite of electromagnetism though because it is also responsible for holding electrically neutral neutrons in the center of atoms as well Even though this is a force we cant directly experience the world has experienced its effect How Because you see the release of this force is the energy behind nuclear bombs The fission and fusion of atoms releases huge amounts of binding energy from the nucleus of atoms which results from the strong force The binding energy of this force is in fact responsible for most of the mass of any object not the Higgs field as you might have thought And when this binding energy is released the mass of the atom is converted to energy in nuclear reactions Then we get to the weak force This is responsible for a type of radiation called beta radiation which is the emission of electrons or its antimatter equivalent positrons One of the most important processes in nature is the beta decay of a neutron This happens for example when a neutron decays into a proton an electron and an antineutrino If this kind of decay had not occurred then the universe would have been awash in a sea of neutrons and no atoms would have ever formed and we would not have had life This process is also important in making larger atoms stable because a similar decay called beta plus decay occurs when a proton is converted into a neutron a positron and an electron neutrino It results in positron emissions and this process allows for nuclear stability Like the strong force this force is also only effective at really small scales But the range is even shorter than the strong force Its effective length is only about one thousandth the diameter of a proton Now Ive tried to give you an overall perspective on the four fundamental forces But if youre like me you probably have a few questions First you might ask how exactly does a force between particles work What is the underlying mechanism What causes an attraction or repulsion And why does electromagnetism and gravity have an infinite range but the strong and weak force have such a small range The answer to these questions are closely related and they get into some of the most cutting edge and complex science involving quantum mechanics and particle physics And this will be the subject of my next video So stay tuned You wont want to miss it In the meantime

            "Reference summary for training sample 493: In this video Im going to share with you five tips that I use to get the most out of the hybrid classroom Welcome back to my channel Charlies Lessons and thank you for coming back to watch another video In this video were looking at hybrid learning And when I say hybrid learning what I mean is that we have two groups of students One group is facetoface or in person and the other group is online The teacher is with the facetoface students providing instruction to both the online students and the facetoface students Now hybrid learning is the result of the current COVID pandemic but this is not the first time that teachers around the world have had to deal with a pandemic and have students learning remotely If we go back to Chicago in 1937 during a polio outbreak students were sent home and received their classes via the radio Can you imagine your students learning via the radio You want to come in with me and meet some of my dog friends You just turn the page every time I whistle like a fella whistling for his dog Mum the radio stopped working Shall I call the teacher Okay Ill call the teacher now Mum why is everything in this house so old So just be thankful for the technology you do have at your disposal that allows you to see hear and interact with your students I think its important to let you know what hybrid learning looks like for me in my school because every teacher has a slightly different setup In my classroom we connect the online students to the facetoface classroom via a Zoom call We have a wideangle camera that sits just on top of the monitor that captures the teacher and the rest of the students that are facetoface We also have two microphones one connected up to the teacher and one mobile microphone that the teacher can move around the classroom to capture what any student is saying So lets get started with the five tips and ideas I have for the hybrid classroom Now I must say that these ideas require that your students both online and facetoface have access to a mobile device a tablet or a computer This is because in a hybrid classroom its important to create a space where the students can interact given that the students are not physically in the same place My first piece of advice is to make sure that you balance your attention as a teacher between the students online and the students in person When you start teaching hybrid the tendency is to pay more attention to the students that you have in front of you physically than the students that you have online And obviously this can be a disadvantage for those students who are studying online who being online and being remote already feel removed from the classroom So you need to make that extra effort to make sure that you attend to their needs and you interact with them as much as possible Tip number two is to make sure that you spend time with your students introducing how to use new tools and platforms before you start using them So if you have students facetoface one week and online the next make sure you spend that time with them facetoface to go through a tutorial on how to use any new tools that youd like to introduce as a result of your new hybrid classroom If any of the next three ideas Im going to show you are new to you then try to find some time with your students facetoface to go through a stepbystep tutorial on how to use these in the classroom Tip number three is using a platform called Nearpod Now if youve never heard of Nearpod before then make sure you go and watch my full tutorial in which I explain how to use it from scratch right here The reason why Nearpod is perfect for the hybrid classroom is that it is a platform that brings in the facetoface students and online students and moves them together at the same pace with the teacher controlling how quickly they go The Nearpod lesson library has a wealth of content you can use with your students My recommendation has to be the VR field trips These are hands down the most enjoyable experience for my students With the VR field trips you can make trips to various cities around the world that the students probably havent been to And by doing this you can notice describe or even compare what the students see in various different cities Tip number four is a website called whiteboardfi And the reason I love using this in my hybrid classroom is that it gives me an opportunity as the teacher to monitor directly what all the students are doing in the class With whiteboardfi you can share a link with your students and they can access a whiteboard that is also shared with you As the teacher you can see what all the students are doing on each individual whiteboard So with younger learners I often do activities like drawing and spelling So for example with drawing I might call out a vocabulary item and the students have to draw correctly what I said With spelling I might also call out a similar vocabulary item but ask the students to spell their answer With perhaps higher level students we might be doing a task in the book or I might ask an open question and Ill ask the students to write their answer in their whiteboard Theres also an option to push my whiteboard as the teacher so that the other students can see it This is perfect for instruction giving This way I can type out some instructions Id like the students all to see And when I finish writing up my instructions all I do is press the push button and in all the students both online and face to face can see this Tip number five is using a website called classkickcom Now like with Nearpod and whiteboardfi the reason I use Class Kick with my hybrid classroom is that I can connect the online students with the face to face students to work and collaborate in the same space Class Kick works by first setting up a roster for your class so you add all the students names to the roster You then can create an assignment The students are given a class code or link and the students enter the assignment as their name and the teacher can see all the students working through the same task together While working on a task students at any time can raise a hand if they need help or support by the teacher The teacher sees this from the main screen and can then click on the slide or part of the activity the student is currently on This way the teacher and the student are seeing the same task together and the teacher can provide help and assistance with the problem the student has The great thing about Class Kick is students can enter in information via text drawing but also links to websites taking photos and recording audio With the students ability to record audio this makes it perfect for the English language classroom So let me show you some of the ways Ive been using Class Kick with my class The first way Ive been using Class Kick with my class is really simple Once Ive created my roster for my class I go to assignments click on the plus sign at the top and create a new assignment Ive created three slides here and all I want to do is use a PDF from our classwork and have our students work through it So I go to the first slide click background click on import background and import a PDF of the activity Id like to use Now Im going to divide this activity into various parts So I just select the first 12 questions and click next Now this has been uploaded to the slide I want to make it interactive for the students So I select add fill in the blank Im then going to complete all of these For slide two I select the next section of the activity and I continue this until Ive got the whole activity separated into parts for my students to complete Once all the students have logged in I can follow their progress here The second idea for younger learners is to use the draw function and ask the students to draw vocabulary that youre learning So for example and I can add an instruction for slide two and slide three From the teacher view I can click on a slide and leave a positive comment And this will appear on the student slide Idea number three is to use the record audio function to practice pronunciation with your students In this example were looking at an activity for younger learners But what Id have them do is I would upload these flashcards onto one slide and ask the students to record themselves pronouncing the words correct I could then go and listen to their recording and add my own recording so the students could listen if they made any mistakes With older learners I was looking at word stress and it was the same idea I would give them a background like this I would ask them to add an audio and I would listen to that as a teacher and record a second audio myself if I felt there were mistakes in the pronunciation or in this case the word stress The final idea I want to share with you is to use the add link option just here and include an article that youd like your students to read and you can set them comprehension questions So for example lets include an article about Disneyland reopening in California and I set them a comprehension question for example and I would add a fill in the blank option below the question Here the student reads the article and answers the comprehension question Well I hope you find this video helpful If youre teaching hybrid at the moment please share this video with any teacher friends that you have you feel could use some help and ideas Ill see you next time\n",
            "Reference summary for training sample 985: Quantum mechanics is one of the most successful theories in all of science Using its mathematical equations scientists can accurately predict how tiny particles like photons of light and electrons and electrical currents behave It can be used to explain everything from the atomic structure of the elements to the shapes of molecules to the cosmic structure of the universe But amid all its useful equations and accurate predictions a troubling question remains Although quantum mechanics clearly works what does it mean What is it telling us about the true nature of reality The way the universe actually is The rules at the level of atoms and subatomic particles seem to be different from the ones we are used to in our everyday experience They seem weird For example particles appear to be fuzzy and spread out They seem to be in two places at once or two different states at once or affect each other instantly over any distance But is this really what quantum mechanics says All these claims are no more than clumsy attempts to interpret the theory using everyday language But everyday language wasnt designed for the quantum world It was designed for the macro world of classical physics which is what we observe at human scales Here objects can be seen and touched and watched as they follow predictable paths in space at precise speeds that we can measure Surprisingly for such a wellestablished and accurate theory as quantum mechanics there is still no consensus on what it really means Physicists differ in what they think quantum theory tells us about the world Some think its every bit as concrete and definite as our classical world Some see a multiverse where all possibilities exist For others quantum mechanics sets the ultimate limit of how much we can really know about reality If you hear an expert insist that they know what it means be cautious In this video Ill tell you why its so hard to be sure of the answer but also what we can say for sure about it Thats coming up right now Many things inspired me to make this video but one documentary which really influenced me is what I watched on Magellan TV todays sponsor Its called Einsteins Nightmare hosted by one of my favorite educators Jim AlKhalili Jim takes us on a journey starting with Einsteins dislike for the idea that nature could be fundamentally probabilistic and shows how we came to the conclusion that it must be this way This is what we call a natural phenomenon Its a phenomenon that is not just a phenomenon but a natural phenomenon This is only one of thousands of fascinating documentaries on Magellan TV Its a new kind of documentary service created by the filmmakers themselves who bring you the highest quality content Featured topics include science history travel and technology Magellan has a special offer right now for Arvin Ashfiers If you click the link in the description youll get a free one month trial Its totally worth giving it a try I so be sure to click the link in the description If we want to understand quantum mechanics we have to start with the math because thats where the heart of the theory lies But dont worry Im not going to derive any equations just describe them Arguably the most important quantum equation was figured out in the mid1920s by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger He was picking up on the suggestion of French scientist Louis de Broglie that maybe quantum particles can behave like waves Schrödinger came up with an equation to describe this waviness and it looked a lot like the equation scientists had used to describe ordinary waves like those in water This equation may look complicated but at its heart is just an equation describing energy Kinetic energy plus potential energy equals total energy It includes a mathematical function called the wave function which encapsulates all that can be known about a quantum object like an electron or atom or even a molecule The objects wave function usually written as the Greek symbol psi has a particular value at all points in space And this value depends on the that the quantum object is in For a single quantum particle for example in a square box the wave function of the lowest energy state has a single peak in the middle If you know the wave function Schrödingers equation lets you figure out for example where you will find the particle in space or how fast it is traveling or how much energy it has But what is the wave function Thats the key question we need to answer to understand what quantum mechanics is telling us about the world In some ways pretty much all the arguments that still rage about this question boils down to disagreements about what a wave function really is If we plot out a typical wave function for a particle it looks a bit like a wave But a wave of what For example a water wave is made of water molecules But a wave function for a quantum object isnt really made of any substance other than the information about the object The amplitude of a water wave is simply the height of the wave The amplitude of a wave function is simply its value at any point In addition the amplitude of a quantum wave function is generally a complex number which means that it contains some term that is an imaginary number which is the square root of a negative number Its not a whole number like 1 2 3 and so on What does an imaginary number mean Well its not a physically meaningful quantity but they are useful in simplifying the mathematics of anything that oscillates But when we square an imaginary number we get a real number So the square of a wave function the value of psi squared becomes a real number This has no imaginary component so it can correspond to the value of some real measurable quantity At first Schrodinger himself thought that the value of psi squared at any point in space tells us what the density of the quantum object like an electron is at that point In other words maybe the particle really is smeared out almost like a cloud of gas with different densities in different places But he was wrong German physicist Max Born said that the square of the wave function isnt the density of the particle instead its the probability It tells us the probability that well find the particle at that point in space if we look If we add up psi squared for every point in space it will equal one Meaning that if we look everywhere we are bound to find the particle somewhere Borns rule is at the heart of why quantum mechanics is such a peculiar theory and why its so hard to say what it means Compared to what we find in classical physics the equivalent of Schrodingers equation is an equation of motion like the one that describes the path of a basketball We can use Newtons laws of motion to write down a mathematical expression for its trajectory and use it to calculate exactly where the ball will be at each moment in time There are no probabilities No ambiguity We can say for sure that if we look at one particular point in space at a particular time well find the ball there If we look elsewhere in space at that moment we know that we wont find the ball there But a wave function says that for a quantum object we might find the object at many different places in space at any given instant with various probabilities We can never be sure which of these it will be in And in fact if we can measure several different particles with the same wave function in successive experiments we are likely to find it at different places each time The wave function itself can change over time rising and falling like an ordinary wave But this simply changes the probabilities of finding the particle at different places for each instant As the physicist Roland Onnes has put it the wave function is the fuel of a machine that manufactures probabilities Now heres whats particularly perplexing You might think that the wave function tells us where the particle probably is at any point in time But it doesnt tell us that It tells us as I said earlier only the chance of finding it there if we look What if we dont look Well then all we have to go by is the wave function itself which says nothing about where the particle is It only lets us figure out the probabilities of where wed find it if we looked there or made a measurement of some sort there Its often said that the wave function implies that until we look the particle is everywhere or at least its smeared out But thats not really right because Borns rule doesnt mean that Borns rule is only about the probabilities of the outcomes of measurements This mathematical machinery tells us not what the quantum world is like but only what well see if we measure it So the idea that before we measure it the particle is everywhere is not quite correct It doesnt tell us what is It only tells us what we might expect if we look But this also doesnt mean that nothing exists until we look A quantum world exists whether we look at it or not Its just very hard to know exactly what we can say about it before we look beyond what its wave function is And thats whats so peculiar about quantum mechanics Because unlike most other scientific theories it doesnt give us a clue about whats really happening but what we might experience when we measure things It says nothing obvious about what quantum reality itself is like All we can do is try to find the best story to tell about whats really happening Now one story from a famous experiment really does look as though quantum particles can be smeared out This is the famous double slit experiment Richard Feynman called this the central mystery of quantum mechanics The setup of this experiment is something like this We fire photons or electrons or any quantum object one at a time towards two closely spaced slits and then place a fluorescent screen on the other side What we see is a pointlike single flash when the electron hits it after going through the slits This appears normal and nothing special However if we keep firing multiple thousands of electrons one at a time we begin to see an interference pattern This may at first appear to be mysterious How could single electrons fired one at a time interfere when no two electrons had the opportunity to interact with each other But this really shouldnt be such a surprise because it is precisely what quantum mechanics predicts It predicts that we should see an interference pattern because individual electrons are like waves Its very much like a water wave If we sent a water wave through the slits we would see an interference pattern on the other side Similarly individual electrons would behave like a wave that passes through both slits too and this wave would split and emerge from each slit to interfere with each other You might say OK then why dont we see a wave interference pattern on the fluorescent screen when we send just one electron through the slits The reason is because the particle behaves like a wave as long as we dont measure it But the fluorescent screen acts like a measuring device When we measure it at the screen it takes a particlelike position So when electrons hit the screen they are no longer in superposition They lose their quantumness They take on a pointlike appearance because they are measured The wave becomes localized to a fuzzy point The interference pattern is not visible when an individual electron is measured by the screen but if we measure thousands of individual electrons one at a time the interference pattern emerges This happens because more electrons show up on parts of the screen where the probability amplitude is higher due to constructive interference of the wave And they dont show up where the probability amplitude has destructive interference In other words because the Schrodinger equation only gives us probabilities we have to make many repeated measurements of these individual electrons to see if what we measure fits those probabilities And it always does So the double slit experiment should not be a mystery It shows us exactly what quantum mechanics predicts that individual particles have wavelike behavior which can be seen in the collective pattern created by shooting lots of particles through the double slit and measure it Had we not gotten this result we would have to rethink quantum mechanics So again what really is the wave function Is it just math that lets us predict what well see in a quantum experiment Or is it a real physical object like an ocean wave that tells us about the underlying reality that causes those observations Some theories attempt to define the collapse as a real physical process To give you a fuller perspective I invited fellow YouTuber and friend Sabina Hassenfelder to tell you about these as well as her favorite theory Hi Arvind I have one thing to add Quantum mechanics may seem weird to us because its not actually the right theory This is why some physicists have tried to improve quantum mechanics by turning the collapse of the wave function into a physical process This removes the ambiguity about how to interpret the wave function Its a real thing and it really collapses There are three major approaches to this at the moment The probably best known one is Penroses gravitationally induced collapse The idea is that a superposition of quantum particles should also come with a superposition of quantum spacetimes And those Penrose says dont exist long so the wave function collapses Another idea is called spontaneous collapse and the best known example is the GRW model In this model the wave function stochastically collapses a little bit every now and then until its entirely localized And then there is superdeterminism Superdeterministic models are also collapse models but they are not stochastic Instead the apparent randomness of quantum measurements is explained by hidden variables Its not much of a secret that personally I think superdeterminism is correct Thanks for letting me join Thank you Sabina and be sure to check out her channel at the link in the description And while youre there subscribe for some great physics content The problem is we cant really see the wave function of a single particle because when we observe the particle like when the electron hits the screen in the double slit experiment its spread out wave function seems to collapse to a single sharp spike where we find the particle A standard quantum theory with its Schrodinger equation and smooth wave functions doesnt actually provide any description of the measurement process We dont really know why or how the collapse of the wave function happens We have to add in the collapse to the theory in a makeshift sort of way Its even been suggested that our own conscious awareness of the measurement result somehow alters the wave function Theres not really any good reason to think thats true though The collapse happens whether we are looking at it or not How it happens and what causes it to happen is called the measurement problem and its one of the biggest causes of arguments about what quantum mechanics means Some researchers say that we cant deduce much about that underlying reality If all quantum mechanics gives us is probabilities about measurements we just have to accept that thats all we can know And who really cares about a question that seems more philosophical than physical as long as the theory correctly predicts the outcomes of experiments The extreme version of this was summed up by physicist David Mermin in the expression shut up and calculate And its a view that some quantum physicists take today They dont want to bother about questions that lie beyond what we can measure and observe because that doesnt seem like science They just use the theory to calculate what their molecules or devices will do Others go to the opposite extreme They say that at the most fundamental level reality really is a wave function This view is commonly shared by scientists and philosophers who believe in the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics often called the Everettian view because it was first proposed by the physicist Hugh Everett in the 1950s In this view the entire universe is a gigantic wave function and we can probe little bits of this wave function with our experiments Because a quantum wave function encodes many different possible outcomes all those places in space for example that we might observe a particle to be in Everettians say that all of these are equally real We only observe one outcome but the measurement also elicits all the other possible outcomes too in different worlds or universes So while you might measure an electron to be in one location in this world there are other worlds where you measure it in a different spot We experience just one because the measurement itself causes the universal wave function to split into separate universes where a copy of you measures something else These worlds are isolated from each other Many worlds is seen by many who are growing in number as the conservative option the one that adds the least to the bare math of quantum mechanics The fact that there are different interpretations of what might really be happening is unusual for a scientific theory Its a frustration that there doesnt appear to be a good way to test which interpretation is correct Quantum mechanics seems to say that reality works in certain mathematically predictable ways but we can never see it working that way Because when we try to see it by taking a measurement it seems to work a different way And thats what many physicists find so disturbing That quantum mechanics doesnt appear to show that there is a set reality out there independent of how we choose to look at it That seems to fly in the face of all that weve come to believe about science that it can tell us about how reality really is regardless of what we believe But this doesnt mean that an objective reality doesnt exist Quantum mechanics gives us a theory that makes our measurements predictable and it works the same for everyone so its repeatable Predictability and repeatability are the hallmarks of an objective reality But it appears we are not completely independent of this reality since we are also part of the universe that quantum theory describes Perhaps quantum mechanics is simply the kind of theory we need to understand a universe of that kind And if you enjoyed this video give us a like and subscribe for a

knowledge of sustainability and going offgrid to relate to the climate crisis to relate to the bigger picture to relate to our life in a city Today our groceries are officially being shut off So that means were not going to have things that we usually have in our trusty fridge in the cabin but were being left with some staples over here some pasta some oatmeal some things that will make sure that wed somehow survive Weve been curious about where our food comes from how it grows so were going to learn a lot about agriculture and the climate crisis during this experiment Im very nervous I hate being hungry We need to figure out how were going to be subsidizing our calories with the environment around us which is going to be very nerveracking so we need to think of a plan Lets talk about where the energy in our food comes from It all starts with the sun Green plants containing chlorophyll absorb light energy from the sun and then using water and carbon dioxide create glucose which the plant uses for energy to grow When you eat that plant or eat an animal that eats that plant you consume calories that were once light energy from the sun released through nuclear fusion 150 million kilometers away that are now stored in chemical bonds in the fats proteins and carbs we eat Chemist Wilbur Atwater calculated their approximate caloric content to be four calories per gram of protein and carbs and nine calories for fat These figures give us the caloric estimates we see on modern food packaging The average adult male eats around 2500 calories per day but weve been tracking ourselves with an app and we only eat around 1800 calories per day So we want to get as many of those calories from alternative sources and I want to share my idea first Is that okay Yes yours is always so cool So we have a classic fish tank and of course in that fish tank we got a little fishies Oh my gosh theyre raving fish Where the heck did you get these And these fish basically we feed them and they poop out waste Were going to use bacteria that grow on all these rocks at the bottom to turn that waste into a usable energy source for our plants Wow so its like a little mini farm This is called aquaponics and if all goes to plan well be able to grow fresh food without using any soil Oh my God youre so extra Demo for yall thought I got a basket Did you weave it I did not even weave it Ive found an indigenous chef named Sean Adler whos going to help us forage from around our cabin and teach us about the wild flowers that are there and how we can prepare them and eat them and its good to have a guide because you can die So this is Sean Adler who is our expert forager We are Canadians foraging for the first time and think its very important that we acknowledge were on indigenous land specifically the treaty land and territory of Mississaugas of the New Credit Thats important for us to remember as we forage off of the land Lets do it I think this looks like a great place to start foraging Okay Its a nice mixed bush Weve got some pasture This is like a supermarket over here basically Oh my God a supermarket I can get into that Oh I dont know if I have the agility for this I was really trying to show off on that one This is prime From here I can see watercress like all of this Wait so whats watercress Watercress is a great green Try that Just eat it Just eat it Oh my God Yep itll be like a little bit bitter but amazing source of vitamins Thats so good Watercress is number one on the CDCs list of fruits and veg for nutrient density packed with vitamin A C and K Wow Oh my Lord This is basically the best survival food anywhere around Thats the pollen of a cattail At this time of year what you really want is the heart Steam that and its delicious Cattails are a good source of fiber and minerals like manganese Im getting hungry for the salad after all this walking Whats the next sort of thing So the next one I think we should grab for our salad is jewelweed Jewelweed Jewelweed Its right around here Can you find it This Dun dun dun Oh my God its just the first thing I saw that I hadnt seen before When you put water on it the little bit of water that actually does stick it looks like a jewel Oh my gosh Its a really cool plant Jewelweed is not just for delicious salads its juice can treat poison ivy and athletes foot Is there any sort of thought about over foraging Like should we be leaving behind something Yes you dont want to pull the roots And watercress like a lot of herbs when you pinch them it encourages the outer growth So were actually promoting this to branch out Ooh purple pretty flowers here Yeah what about that I dont think this is a good idea This here will make you dead What This has a very apt name This is Deadly Night Shade If we eat these berries we would die It like shuts down your liver and all sorts of organs so this is not edible Okay so this is very real what we are doing Very real Thats insane The forage was a success but we are going to need more calories and protein Since were on a working farm neither of those things are very far away So youre telling me that you want to work so that you can eat Yes meat eggs meat eggs meat protein So thats called farming Oh firefighters Youre like you need to do something to get that Yeah So I actually have to move this chicken coop today and the chickens in the coop So if I go get my tractor can you guys just round up all these chickens and get them in the coop Like we physically get them in there Yes So why are we moving this mobile chicken coop somewhere Why do we even have to do this I am going to use these chickens to fertilize my soil and help scratch open the turf Amazing So this ones done Thats right Okay so theyre functional chickens You should be done by the time I get back with my tractor Okay well see Good luck I know Mitch and Greg are both city boys so I foresee this being an interesting exercise Here chicken chicken Okay they run That seems not catchable It should not take more than 20 minutes Oh jeez Okay weve got this one Oh buddy Oh I didnt even know they could do that Ow Wolfgangs farm uses mobile chicken coops which are regularly moved to new patches of land This one does not want to be caught The chickens scratch and dig the soil when they forage for food which spreads and mixes our soil layers in a very nondestructive way It feels like a really just weird video game Thats too smart One single chicken can till 45 square meters of soil in about four weeks at which point the soil should be ready for crop planting Oh I got one Its okay Mitch Okay Im going to be calm to not stress it out Okay there you go Okay Oh theres poo on my hand now Theres literally poo on my hands All I have is poo on my hand and I havent even caught one chicken Chicken poop has the highest nitrogen phosphorus and potassium content of all animal manure It adds organic matter and helpful bacteria that soil needs to break down plant matter All this increases the health of the soil We just want to put you with your friends Got it Another one Oh my gosh It was devastating for me I really felt like I was going to be good at it Weve got one left Here comes Wolf with the tractor I got her Oh my gosh Im so sorry I left you Are you okay Now gently flip it over Its calm Its calm Okay Oh there you go We did it Did you We just finished You just finished now Yes I feel like you could probably do what we did in three minutes I think its really great that Mitch and Greg are doing this I love the opportunity to bring hard science to something that the average person does not associate with hard science which is agriculture Oh One dozen eggs Thank you so much As promised theres a little bit of poo on them but thats normal Theres poo on my hands Yeah theres literally poo all over us How many farms are doing this versus those large tilling processes Its increasingly popular Agriculture is bad for the planet Full stop Its not what the planet wants Its not whats healthy as for the soil Soil is a living breathing ecosystem with a complex structure of plants roots and microorganisms working together Tilling disrupts that system It breaks up the structure and makes it more vulnerable to being washed away It removes the live roots that are the microbes food It opens up channels that can flood with water then prevents the microbes from getting enough air This not only damages the soil quality but also makes it release chemicals into the waterways and carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere The global population is expected to increase by almost two billion in the next 30 years And over a third of the worlds farmable land is currently being lost to pollution and erosion By the way soil erosion is happening at a rate 100 times greater than soil formation Its clear we have a huge problem We have to think more about how we get our food Im curious as a farmer what advice you have thinking of climate change and the global crisis like how we can shop and think about our food Happy animals make for a happy microecology make for happy soil make for a happy environment We are actively helping to sink some of the carbon in the atmosphere back into the soil When we do that we will starve if we keep just like taking everything we can without putting some back So its as simple as that Well thank you so much Youve taught us so much The last question is are we allowed to let our new best friends out of the coop now It would be weird if we didnt after that conversation Look you got new legs Its satisfying to move a chicken coop and then fertilize new soil and feel like youre helping out with like the biosphere and creating a carbon sink on this farm That feels good With the help of experts Arvind and Gayatri were ready to get our system up and running While our build is small aquaponic systems have a huge global potential Because they rely on water instead of soil to grow crops theyre an effective way of growing food in areas of the world with little to no farmable land Time to fill her up Lets go over this aquaponic cycle just so I can get into my brain Sure We start over with three inputs to the fish tank Thats water oxygen and fish feed Fish consume the feed produce our magic nutrients the microbe families in our filters help break down the fish waste to nitrates and make it readily available for the plants to consume And then the demineralized water goes back into the fish tank and its one happy system A nice big cycle that just repeats over and over Over and over again yes Plants need nitrogen to make the amino acids that are their building blocks Without it they cant grow and theyll lose their green color Although they cant absorb nitrogen from the air their roots can suck up nitrate compounds Weve got our air bubbles going through both tanks Everythings circulating in the system So were going to take our lettuce board place it on top and then tomorrow our fishies come and the whole thing is complete Its time to turn the days harvest into a tasty lunch of fried cattails and salad Okay lets get started chef Well get our cattail hearts cooking Garlic mustard Ill chop it up and then Ill get you to grind it in our mortar Im good at smashing stuff So yeah To all my high school bullies That looks great Im going to make a vinaigrette Were cooking tonight mom Whats going on here Oh its just time for me to toss the salad Oh my gosh Okay whats going on So weve made a garlic mustard pesto fire roasted cattail hearts with our water cress and jewel weed salad Need some color though Oh my God Okay this is the thing Nostertium edible flowers Oh perfect That is great You guys now we can eat Now we can eat Oh yeah It is so fresh Its so delicious I cant get over the cattails Ive never even really tasted anything like it Good job you guys Like I did not expect to come down to like a gourmet meal So good Thank you so much Youve honestly changed my perspective on a lot of things today And without you I think we might have died by eating that nightshade Thank you for saving our lives Youre welcome Good luck guys Should we get a bowl for Ernie Yeah Just daddy and I So hungry and its going to be dark soon Were just going to simply have pasta and go to bed Oh my God That could have been it That could have been it We wanted al dente It might still be really hard well see Very al dente Oh yeah its crunchy It needs more time Were ready to add the fish to our system Although there are many species of fish used in aquaponics were using tilapia because theyre extremely hardy and can survive a wide range of pH and temperatures This is so fun Youre going to help us grow things Youre so great We love you Animals and plants are supposed to live together feeding one another But a lot of the time we break that cycle and have to artificially support each other So were going to have to do that But a lot of the time we break that cycle and have to artificially supply those nutrients Here were building a whole ecosystem making use of what nature already does Our very first aquaponic system is built and complete Wow Now we just wait for our lettuce to grow If our system is working properly we should see significant growth within a few weeks and it will be ready to pick in 28 days While our staples are helping to sustain us we are still hungry and I think I know why Its time to check how close we are to our daily goal of 1800 calories Im calculating how many calories I have foraged and Im nervous Now a calorie is the amount of energy that it takes to increase one milliliter of water by one degree Celsius That is one calorie with a lower KC But the food calories that were all used to reading on packaging is an upper KC calorie which is a thousand of these Its more energy Our foraged greens are a great source of vitamins and minerals but they arent very caloriedense Foods that contain fats and protein have a higher caloric density meaning you get a lot more calories from a smaller portion of food Everything that is edible on this table only adds up to 1179 calories Thats not nearly enough calories I definitely expended more energy getting this than I will be from eating it so I really have to think about how to get protein Proteins are made up of amino acids strung together in chains At its core an amino acid molecule looks like this an amino group of nitrogen and two hydrogen connected to a carboxyl group of carbon oxygen and hydrogen bonded to a side chain The side chain or R group is what makes each amino acid different Here is a bunch and you can think of them all as an alphabet of letters that our body strings together to create proteins These proteins keep you alive so your body needs amino acids to build the chains that make up your proteins Your body can make most amino acids but those it cannot are called essential amino acids and ultimately you need to eat protein with these essential amino acids in order to live If you do not your body takes amino acids from your muscles and you dont want that Thats why lots of gym bros always eat so much protein so their muscles get bigger Since essential amino acids are vital for survival its time to head back into the woods and forage for some protein Follow the birds Part of the challenge is this season A lot of highcalorie highprotein foods like nuts and seeds are only available in the fall here in Ontario So this is an immature black walnut Theyre going to grow about three or four times that size You can see the nut inside hasnt formed yet Sean had shown us some walnuts but they were still too early to eat so Ill need to get creative Earthworms are 60 to 70 protein so theyre the way that we are going to be getting protein from foraging and they have essential amino acids lysine and methionine They actually have more per gram essential amino acids than meat and fish They also have vitamin B12 and omega3 fatty acids They also have lots of calcium more than even cheese per gram Oh Oh Here she goes This is hell This is what our tenth salad I dont know Weve had a lot of a salad Theres hardly any protein in this So far I feel like we havent like got a whole system figured out for how we actually feed ourselves You promised you were working on something for like more sustenance more protein right Oh youre going to love it Mitch Just you wait Is it going to be bad Sorry I almost just threw up in my mouth Oh Thats a little foreshadowing OK maybe Ill stick with the salad I hate it I hate it I hate it I hate it I hate it Oh Im sorry While earthworms are edible they must be boiled to remove any bacteria like E coli from their digestive tract to before you can eat them Were going to need a lot of sauce I was picturing you know like a meaty red but weve ended up with a beigey bluegreen Hahaha Great OK here we go Oh theres a lot of dirt Oh my God Never show this to Mitch Im not even kidding Hes going to murder me when he watches this No I just squirted OK A little salt oatmeal eggs and herbs quickly transforms the mushy worms into something seemingly palatable Have you ever been more appetised in your life It actually smells good It actually smells good Im not just saying that I know I did almost just ralph all over the place about 20 times but that is a bit of a gorgeous meatball OK The whole experience of making the earthworm meatballs is a blur to me of adrenaline and fear and I was just boiling earthworms alive which made me feel bad but then I felt bad that I didnt care because I was eating them I felt bad that I didnt care because they were worms Our aquaponic system has been up and running for a bit now but we want to check in on the progress to make sure its working Tada Our test is done and we can see that the lettuce are starting to grow Theres no soil Thats so great Yeah This is a great sort of smallscale diorama but could a fish farm do this 100 Some of them are already starting to do it So you have the fish making the nutrients and instead of dealing with that waste and putting it into lakes and oceans you can actually use it to create more food This is a great alternative for places that are in food deserts that dont have the ability with rich soil to grow agriculture in the same way Yeah Do we want to do a little taste test Yeah for sure OK Cheers Cheers I was a little concerned that it might taste like fish and it doesnt at all taste like lettuce Oh my God imagine tilapia That tastes really good Tastes like lettuce Our aquaponic setup is working but because the lettuce hasnt grown enough for us to eat were leaving the system on the farm where they can use it to grow crops in the future Lots of oil Something were going to hope is going to help Oh the sizzle Ooh I never plan to eat earthworms As a vegetarian I have ample amounts of peanuts on my hand to get my protein some quinoa Its looking like a meatball This is exciting It just looks like theres a little bit of like intestines and plastic tubes spilling out of one of them But other than that it looks pretty good Hola Micho Welcome to my Italian restaurant Have a seat Its beautiful Its very cute Im just like where are they Michos going to have to eat this because its on camera but I am very much worried for him I think he might hate it I think I might hate it I am nervous This whole meal 198 calories have been forged Its the most calories weve got thanks to these earthworm meatballs Thats actually a lot for one meal Here you go Enjoy Oh my God Like it actually doesnt look that bad but I just actually feel so sick right now Theres a lot of pressure for me to eat this thing because I did make it myself Im just hoping that we dont get sick Im hoping that we arent eating whats inside the worms which could be feces e coli you name the protozoa it could be there Okay Im going to get some sauce Cheers Okay Going in Its not that bad actually I dont mind it I dont mind it We have a little pasta as a palate cleanser I really dont like when you can kind of sort of see the intestinal looking parts of the worm Wait wheres the Dont look close Matt Keep eating What did you season it with Herbs Salt pepper and oil So is this a romantic meal Bleh This experience made me realize we obviously rely on the current systems to get our food like grocery stores but I want to figure out how we can work together to make these systems less damaging Im thinking about community gardens Im thinking about access to green space parks places where we feel happy and also can maybe forage We also need to acknowledge that our food has a huge impact on the environment A recent study found that just 20 meat and dairy companies emit more greenhouse gases than Germany Britain or France And they receive billions of dollars in funding to do so But while corporations are disproportionately responsible for global emissions our individual choices in what we choose to eat can make a difference When you know where your food comes from when you understand its impact on the environment it can actually change your behaviour And maybe theres a company out there that can figure out how to make earthworms taste good No Theres a bit of sandy texture A bit of dirt It actually doesnt taste bad Every single time Im aware that its a worm then it freaks me out And Im sure the spaghetti aspect doesnt help that Yeah thats true Why do we have to have spaghetti with the earthworm Just like looks more What would pair well with an earthworm Or an earthy mezcal Or like coffee to Kahns Ballad or something Considering this just came from the ground near our cabin its pretty amazing And its high caloric intake Honestly the apocalypse is coming Youre all going to have to eat this soon anyway So whos laughing now\n",
            "Reference summary for training sample 141: These are called Friedman numbers It can be written in a nontrivial way just using the digits itself together with any combination of your usual mathematical signatures plus minus times divide You can even raise things to a power and you can use some combination of brackets if necessary So 25 is a Friedman number Why is 25 a Friedman number Because it can be written in terms of the two digits that make it up as 5 to the power 2 So Ive just used the raising power operator to do that 121 same sort of idea 2 ones form 11 and I raise it to the power 2 and Ive got 121 Immediately Im seeing this could be described as recreational mathematics Its the kind of thing I used to have great fun playing with but actually theres some really neat things you can do with it The brackets youve got to be a little bit careful with Youre not allowed just to simply wrap one number up in a bracket So 125 is 5 to the power of 2 plus 1 So Im just using the brackets there to add the 2 and the 1 and make up 3 so 5 cubed is 125 Well if I wanted to go for 1 say with 4 digits then 9261 is 21 to the power of 9 minus 6 So theres actually 72 of these numbers with 4 or less digits and theres a really nice sort of subset of them 14 of these are known as nice Friedman numbers Well a nice Friedman number is where the order of the digits remains the same So a simple one is 127 127 is made up of minus 1 plus 2 to the power 7 The order of the digits 127 is the same as appears on the right hand side Whereas if I say took 125 the left hand side is 125 but the right hand side is 521 or 512 Is that not nice Not formally nice For many of us we quite enjoy 125 Its got many nice properties But on this occasion its not a nice number not a nice Friedman number anyway So you could do I mean if I want to just get a bit bigger 343 for example is just made up of 3 plus 4 to the power 3 Or I could get a bit bigger and 6455 is made up of 6 to the power 4 minus 5 all times 5 So you get the idea that you can make up various combinations And in fact weve already come across a class of these vampire numbers that weve done videos with So vampire numbers are made up of these where instead of using all the various combinations were just using the multiplication So vampire numbers are an example So 1260 is a vampire number but its also a Friedman number because its 21 times 60 You know you can get a bit bigger So weve got 5 digit numbers of which there are 272 of them by the way 101 92 which is 101 to the power 2 minus 9 And if I went to a 10 digit one 8 3 2 6 1 9 7 5 or 4 whats that equal to 91248 to the power of 5 minus 3 plus 0 times 67 The 0 times 67 together have they just used the 0 there to cheat away Well the notes in here and so its part of it But it does make there is an interesting caveat which we have to I should have mentioned You cant have leading zeros theyre not allowed For example something like 001729 and write that as 1700 plus 29 Im not allowed to have the leading zeros in there in that definition But there is some neat one theres some even more Better than this is It gets better Whats the smallest number the smallest Friedman number that I can make up when Im just repeating the same digit These are called rep digits arent they Rep digits rep digits okay And the smallest is 1 2 3 These are all nines 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 And its made up of 9 plus 9 over 9 to the power of 9 minus 9 over 9 minus 9 over 9 How about ones So now weve got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 And that is equal if Ive got my algebra right 11 minus 1 to the power of 11 minus 1 times 1 divided by 11 minus 1 minus 1 So theyve got the same number on the right hand side Why are you laughing Because its just cool But I havent finished Theres more Theres more How about if I ask the following Theres a set of numbers called your pandigital We have covered pandigital numbers Oh youve done Yeah okay Well you havent done pandigital Friedman numbers I bet Heres one right So a pandigital number is the one that includes all the numbers in any given base So if I say 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Well I can write that as a Friedman number because thats equal to I think I need two brackets 86 plus 2 times 7 to the power of 5 minus 91 all divided by 3 to the power of 4 So thats one pandigital number We can do another one 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Right And this is 8 times 97 plus 6 over 2 to the power of 5 plus 1 again divided by 3 to the power of 4 You might say is it easy to get a nice pandigital number And indeed theyre there but theyre not that easy to get There is one here 2 6 8 4 3 5 1 7 9 And that is equal to remember whats nice about it is the order remains the same The order of the numbers remains the same So its minus 268 plus 4 to the power of 3 times 5 minus 1 to the power of 7 minus 9 And that will give you back your original number It turns out as a number of digits and the number increases the likelihood of it being a Friedman number also increases If there are f of n Friedman numbers less than any given number n then it turns out and I dont know the proof of this I havent been through it that as n increases the ratio of f of n over n tends to 1 In other words the likelihood of finding a number tends to unison So given a distribution of numbers of larger n then you pick a number at random then the likelihood is that its actually a Friedman number So the higher we go in the number line the more dense it becomes with Friedman numbers Yeah I think thats right Numberphile is supported by the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute But while we show you these Friedman numbers in Roman numerals wed also like to thank these viewers who support us on Patreon And if youd like to get involved and maybe even adopt a number on our website just for the fun of it details are in the video description\n",
            "Reference summary for training sample 244: Hi everyone welcome to episode 9 So there are just two pretty simple things that I want to get done in this video The first is to get collisions working for both 3D and 2D mode And the second is to get a texture mapped across here Now just considering 2D mode as you can see wed have to rotate the mesh 270 degrees to get it to actually be visible But now the problem comes in where we try to add 2D colliders to an object thats rotated like this You can see its not very happy So what were going to do instead is were going to keep the map generator object unrotated And we will add the colliders to this object And then well create a separate object for the mesh to go on which we can rotate if were in 2D mode So lets create an empty child and Im going to call this cave mesh And Im going to add a mesh filter and a mesh renderer to here And also just apply the cave material there And on the map generator we can just delete the two mesh components from here since were not having a mesh on this object anymore Lets go into the mesh generator and create a public mesh filter variable for our cave And instead of assigning the cave mesh to this object well assign it to the cave object So now if we just run this oops we need to actually apply that first of course If we run it now we would just need to rotate this 270 degrees Of course in 2D mode we dont actually want the walls to be generated since you cant see them So lets create a public bool and call this is2d And well only call create wall mesh if not is2d All right so just do that So let us start with 3D collisions Essentially what were going to do is were going to add a mesh collider to the walls Just to test it out lets create a plane for our ground Im going to size this up Something like that Call that ground Since Im in play mode its going to delete itself when I go out of play mode so Ill just copy it first and paste it back in Just put it under there Lets also create a C sharp script and were going to create a very simple player controller Just something thats got a rigid body to move it around In the start method we can just assign rigid body r equal to getComponent of type rigidbody We also want a vector3 variable for our velocity In the update method we can just say that velocity is equal to a new vector3 And well get inputs on our horizontal and our vertical axes InputgetAxisForAllvertical Lets normalize this vector3 and multiply it by some speed Because were using a rigid body we want to do all of our actual movement in the fixed update method Well say rigidbodymovePosition And well give it our starting position rigidbodyposition plus the velocity multiplied by timefixedDeltaTime Lets create a little 3D object to be our player Drag it up there Lets create a player material Ill just make this an unlit color something red So its nicely visible just assign it Lets drag our player script on there as well as a rigidbody Im going to make my game window bigger Turn off gizmos So now if we play of course were not colliding with the walls So were going to go into MonoDevelop again into the MeshGenerator script And where were creating the wall mesh right at the end we want to add a MeshCollider to our wall object We can say MeshCollider we can call it our wall collider is equal to wallsgameobjectaddComponent We want to add a MeshCollider And then we can simply say wallCollidersharedMesh is equal to the wall mesh that weve just created Okay that should do the trick So if we press play we can see walls have now got a MeshCollider added to them And our player is constraining to collisions So thats cool Lets set it up for 2D now Im going to call this scene 3D Im going to duplicate it and create a 2D version So lets go into that 2D version and in here Ill say is2D And Im going to take my cave mesh Im going to rotate it 270 degrees Im going to do the same thing with my ground in fact 270 So now if we go into 2D mode press play lets see if this is working Okay I think it is working but we want this ground plane to just move back a bit Okay thats good For our little player guy here Im going to create a 2D version of this player script Ill just call that player2D Open it up Rename it over here as well And instead of a rigid body it will be a rigidbody2D Instead of a vector3 it will be a vector2 Just change all of these things This is a vector2 as well Just remove that And the rest looks good Save Okay no errors Im going to remove the rigidbody and the player script and add instead Oops I should also remove the box collider Add instead a rigidbody2D a box collider2D and my player2D script Okay so now if I press play we should be able to move around here Lets quickly get the camera working Put it there And we need to move it on the Z axis Im just going to turn down the size a bit and position it somewhere so we can see the whole map Okay that looks nice Lets start generating the 2D colliders So going into the mesh generator script Lets see So if not 2D were creating the wall mesh If it is 2D then we want to create some 2D bounds So Im going to say if is2D otherwise create the wall mesh So if it is 2D then generate 2D colliders Okay thats a good name for a method Copy that and lets create the method over here And we want to start off by calculating the mesh outlines because we are going to use that information So just to refresh your memory calculate mesh outlines is going to give us a list of outlines and each outline is made up of a list of integers and those integers refer to the vertices in the vector3 list So what we want to do is we want to go through each of the outlines So for each list of integers which well call outline in the outlines list we want to create a new edge collider 2D for each of them So well say edge collider 2D well call this edge collider is equal to and we want to add the new component to this game object Game objectadd edge collider 2D just like that So to actually set the edge collider well want to use edge colliderpoints which is just an array of vector 2s So lets make a new array of vector 2s which well call our edge points and this is equal to a new array of vector 2s with a length of the number of vertices that make up our outline So outlinecount and then were going to have a for loop 4 into i equals 0 Were going to go through each of the elements in our outline So i less than outlinecount i and then well say edge points i is equal to the vertex in the vertex list So that is vertices and that is with an index of outline i Alright So now having done that we can say edge colliderpoints is equal to edge points Now obviously each time that we generate a new map and calculate these colliders we want to actually start off by removing all of the current colliders So well say edge collider 2D array which well call our current colliders is equal to gameobjectgetComponents So were getting every edge collider 2D thats currently attached to this game object and we want to go through them all 4 into i equals 0 i less than current colliderslength i We want to go through them all and destroy each of them destroy current colliders i Alright So now lets see if this is working Actually it wont be working Ive just realized when we are setting the edge points this is a vector 2 array and these are all vector 3s so we need to convert them to vector 2s but we cant just cast them like so We need to actually take the zaxis and put that as the yaxis So well create a new vector 2 and use the x value from here for the x and the z value for the y Alright lets run this and if we just click on our map generator you can see the edge collider 2D thats been added all around and let me just move my player around You can see hes constraining nicely to collisions and if I click to generate a new map you can see the collider is being destroyed and then added again Cool So the next step is the texturing Okay so lets go to the mesh generator script and Im going to go up to where we created the cave mesh and what we want is an array of vector 2s Each vector 2 will belong to a single vertex and it will basically say the percentage of that vertex on the xaxis in the map and on the yaxis in the map So lets create a new vector 2 array we can call this our UVs its equal to a new vector 2 array and however many vertices we have thats how many vectors we want So just use verticescount as the size and then well have yet another for loop into i equals 0 I want to go through each of the vertices so i less than verticescount i plus plus and we want to get the percent x first of all for the vertex So weve got three bits of information we know the position of the vertex on the xaxis and we can figure out where our map starts on the xaxis and where it ends on the xaxis So we can use mathfinverse alert to figure out the percentage from this So we want to first give it the far left of our map so that will be negative map width divided by 2 So negative map dot get length 0 for the xaxis and we need to multiply that by the square size that we allow to be specified For 2 that will just be the positive version of this oh I didnt divide by 2 that should be in there Alright and then we pass in our actual vertex x value Alright and we want to do the same thing for percent y only here we want to replace this with vertices i dot z Okay then we can quite simply say uvs i is equal to a new vector 2 using percent x and percent y Okay to test this Im just going to drag in a rock texture I found and Im going to apply this to the cave material Alright like that lets run it Okay not exactly working Very good reason for that we havent actually done anything with this uvs array Okay we need to say mesh dot uvs rather uv is equal to our uvs Alright hopefully well have more success this time Okay we do thats brilliant its being applied At the moment it is massive we want to make a way to be able to tile it So what we can do is we can just go in here and create an int tile size or tile amount Set this equal to 10 just to try that out And we can just multiply our percent x by the tile amount Like so And that should make it repeat however many times we set our tile amount to So lets give that another go And that looks pretty cool Okay yeah thats everything for this episode I hope youve enjoyed and see you next episode Cheers\n",

improve your speaking skills quickly Okay are you ready Lets get started Music Hahahaha There was a bad man named Dr Agma He had plans to take over the world The only way to stop him was to destroy the artificial intelligence program on his computer with a special virus The only person who could do this difficult mission was Agent Jake Vaughn Jake jumped out of a plane with his parachute He landed near Dr Agmas headquarters Jakes partner called him from the operation center and explained his mission She told him to go to the application center and install the virus Jake and his partner were on the way to the operation center The operation center was in the middle of the city The operation center was in the middle of the city Jake entered Agmas center through the underground tunnels And he arrived at the basement He headed to the entrance door and saw the incoming mail He hid inside one of the boxes The man carrying the mail didnt notice him and took him to the warehouse There Jake knocked the man unconscious and wore his clothes Now he looked like a postman So no one realized that he was an agent This way he passed through the document room and got on the elevator Then he reached the application center Jake put on his special glove He unlocked the security by swiping the special glove and entered the application center Inside he turned on the main computer He entered the password and installed the special virus He entered the password and installed the special virus Thanks to the virus he destroyed all of Dr Agmas plans Finally one more mission was completed

            "Reference summary for testing sample 793: Hey guys today were gonna look at the Vuejs 2 complete guide So Im gonna go over it and were gonna see the good things about it And by the way I put a link below to that course so stay tuned all the way to the end and find out what its all about Alright so if you guys arent familiar with Udemy you can go to udemycom They sell some amazing courses and by the way they have a sale going on right now for 1099 You can get any one of their courses So I thought this week Im gonna go ahead and just do some reviews on some of my favorite courses I put a link below with the link to the courses If you go ahead and buy any of the courses through those links I get a couple bucks It helps the channel so thank you if you do that So when I search for Vuejs there is three different courses that come up that are kind of the most popular ones out there on Udemy And thats the Vuejs 2 the complete guide Vuejs 2 the mastering web apps and the ultimate Vuejs 2 developers course Now today Im not gonna go over David Katzs the Vuejs 2 mastering web apps or the ultimate Vuejs 2 developers course Maybe in the future Ill look at that I know Anthony Gore makes some pretty good courses too but I havent taken his So lets take a look at Max Amillians Schwarzmuller And if you dont know Max is also a YouTuber He has a YouTube channel where he does different tutorials and Vuejs and other technologies And he has this course And I think hes one of the first people to create one of these Vuejs 2 courses So lets take a look a little bit about it And you can see here theres 375 lectures Theres already 34000 students involved in it Its 21 hours of content So you definitely get a jampacked amount of content with this course And of course every time you buy a Udemy course you get a lifetime access on it And you know theres tons of good information tons of reviews on it And he says that he knows how to teach splits every detail into smaller parts and makes another video for each part For this reason you dont feel yourself boring while watching videos Because lots of them are 2 minutes not more No matter what metric you look at Vuejs is the shooting star in the world of JavaScript framework So that is true Vuejs is becoming extremely popular So yeah it definitely covers all the basics And were going to go and look at the curriculum or the course content I cant actually show you the videos unfortunately but I can kind of give you an idea of the different course content And I can explain it Ive watched a bunch of it I havent watched every single thing on it but I think I have a pretty good idea of what its all about So definitely directives filters and mixins And then it kind of gives you here are the types of students that love this course Who have some JavaScript experience that have come over from Angular 2 or Reactjs So the requirements basic Java knowledge is required ES6 knowledge is a plus So this is kind of nice He put a little bit more information in there of who can take this course Really if you have a little bit of JavaScript knowledge I think youre probably okay When I watched it he goes over a lot of the concepts Of course if you dont have any JavaScript knowledge you may want to take a look at it below I put a link to Colt Steels course below That might be the complete web developers boot camp That might be a better choice for you if you completely knew If you have some knowledge or youre coming from React or Angular or youve dipped your toe in the JavaScript world and you want to start off with a new framework I mean this was a great one to start with Its really easy to get started up and running in Vuejs And by the way Ill add one more plug My book The Vuejs in Action its in early access You guys can buy it today If you rather watch something or read something I guess it depends on what you like If you want to get kind of really indepth examples on a lot of different things the first seven chapters are out By the time you watch this I might have eight or nine out Well see But you can just have a link below to where you can get the book And by the way you can get the first three chapters two or three chapters for free Actually the first chapter is definitely for free If you click on the link below you can get that free chapter So you can kind of take a look to see if you like it So of course the target audience is for anyone interested in frontend development And I can never pronounce Maximillians I think Maximillian Schmorsmuller Im not very good at it So he actually has a slight accent If youre from the United States I have an accent of course If youre outside the United States youll notice he does have a little bit of an accent But of course he explains topics really well I mean theres no problem there I can understand it very very well He says he stopped learning new program languages He started learning at age 13 so hes been doing this for a while So thats a little bit about the overview Course content This is obviously the meat of the application of the course that is So he has a getstarting getstarted This is really just how to set up Vue locally kind of the basics you expect in any sort of course And then he goes into interacting with the DOM Most tutorials in Vuejs kind of have this flow right here They always go interacting with the DOM Like how do you deal with a Vue instance How do you raw output HTML The double brackets binding things like that Twoway data binding I kind of skim through a lot of this dynamic styling This is all really good stuff And then V4 Vf the directives Thats where he goes into next This is real good Now Ill have to say he does kind of interlay in different courses Inside the course he puts different projects which I really like I like my tutorials where I have lots of information and then some way to tie it all in So its just not kind of that boring Heres Vf directive heres this How can we tie it into a bigger kind of something a little bit bigger maybe a little more real world So this is his first course project the Monster Slayer So it kind of goes over some of the concepts so thats perfect And then he kind of goes back into the Vue instance It gets a little bit more technical how to update the DOM Then really a lot of courses and I did this too with my book is you start with kind of the basics using Vue as a CDN Youre importing it into your HTML files But really the way that most modern Vue apps are created is with Webpack and Vue CLI because it gives you access to something called single file components which he goes over these vue files which makes creating your Vue applications much easier because you really want to be able to build your application to a bunch of different components And if youre not if you just bring it in through an HTML and the CDN its a little more difficult And you also get some other kind of nice things with it with Scope CSS and a few other things So its definitely well worth it And he looks like he you know he covers it pretty well in this Vue pack CLI Then he goes deep dives into components This is kind of smart because you can do definitely definitely before you learn about Vue pack Webpack and Vue CLI you can do components I kind of wish he would have taught a little bit more of that before this section but its it works either way So he talks about it here the root component better folder structures Definitely talking about props how to pass things in between different components This is a really fundamental feature of Vue Its youre kind of having all these building blocks these components you definitely need to talk to them And it kind of dovetails nicely into Vue X which he talks about later But you could talk about props the event bus which is a little bit more sophisticated way to move information between Vue It does have a little bit of advanced components Slots is a way you can kind of put information in there And then he has another course So like I said hes really good about this He shows a lot of these different concepts and then he ties it back into a course or an actual project which I think makes it all solidify a lot easier I mean its not the greatest Its just kind of a simple app but I think it kind of helps bring all these concepts together I know some courses the projects are pretty much the whole course Like you have a project and then you bring in the different things I guess it just depends on your teaching style I kind of prefer if its more course more projects than than the not And then user input directives like creating custom directives So these these are a little bit more advanced You could definitely taught these a little bit earlier I think in the course But I mean theyre fine where they are Animations transitions Now I thought this interesting Now he does teach view resource which is not on the official recommendation list anymore for VJS It was kind of not recommended by Avenue He created a blog post about that a while ago and Im pretty sure this course was before that So I would just skip this whole V resource I mean this would not I would not use it I mean you can still use it but I would just skip it because its not really officially recommended I mean it still works but theres Axios and some other libraries that work just as well And he actually goes into that later So routing is pretty important here It goes into a lot of different writing examples And then this is probably the best section I think of his whole of the whole course is view X because you can be a very complicated subject and he does definitely break it down I just did a video on view X a little bit earlier this year and I kind of did that same approach Just try to I actually even did more I tried to take everything he taught in like three hours and I condensed it to about 10 minutes So just really the basics of using view X And its a lot It can be a lot easier than than it looks like This goes into excruciating detail now and even goes in at the end He starts doing like separating into different modules and auto namespacing and all that which is interesting And then he ties it into the shock trader which is probably you could probably start here and learn everything all the concepts This is probably the best project he has in the whole inside the whole course And it looks like at the end he has these bonus sections and I think that he just added these later because just kind of pad up the well actually Well in the case this this one the V resource V resources is kind of going kind of not officially recommended anymore So he did an axial section By the way this deploying section is pretty sparse I dont think youre going to get much out of this deploy section if I had one little criticism of it But its nice Its nice Its in here and authentication view apps I really like this He even goes into guards which is kind of protected routes off guards Its really the great the way you want to do authentication Thats kind of a common question I always hear too when people are learning these single page application frameworks Like how do you do authentication You know how do we how do we do that And this this goes over it This is this is a pretty good way of doing it And he uses Firebase in the back end I actually my book I use Firebase to Its just a real easy way of of demonstrating how to do these type of things without having to create your whole back end and muddle everything up And then he I guess he added form input and validation So he adds this and another like plug in And I didnt see anywhere through here Theres a couple other things like view to fi which is pretty popular I didnt see anything on view to fi here anywhere So thats kind of a real popular library Its kind of like bootstrap you can use for the view world But I mean overall I mean its an excellent course So I was really impressed by it I mean Maximilian he goes over it very well You know I would highly recommend this course to anyone thats want to jump into view and get your feet wet on it And Im really interesting Maybe later Ill go back and Ill look at some of the other VJS two courses and let you know kind of what my feelings are Like I said I know Anthony Gores is pretty good too But yeah so if you like this this review can I go ahead and just pay for it Just click on that link below I get a couple of bucks if you buy any courses through it And I would buy its on sale now for like eleven bucks for twenty two hours Its not a bad deal So thanks everybody Leave a comment below Let me know what you guys think of this course Id be interested to hear Thanks\n",
            "Reference summary for testing sample 209: Hello everyone this is Reshma from Edureka and Im very excited to take up my first live session here on YouTube So thank you all for joining this session on Git And in this session well majorly focus on the different workflows on Git and how to handle merge conflicts when they arise So this is the agenda for today So well take a brief introduction to Git Youll see all the Git commands that we use the different Git workflows that different dev teams follow and how to handle merge conflicts in each of the workflows So this is the short agenda for today Now let us take a brief look at what is Git and what does it actually do So Git is a version control software that is mainly used in software development to manage your code better And how exactly does it manage your code better It helps by keeping versions of your code So lets say that you have got your source code file and in time youll keep making changes to it Maybe like adding new features or doing bug fixes And sometimes you would want to go back to the previous versions because the newly added features might not be working out the way you want to or because of any other reasons And Git will help you to roll back because it has been keeping snapshots every time you change something And these snapshots are known as version one So lets say that this is your initial code You made some other changes in the initial code Theyll keep a version for that And similarly as time passes by it will keep different versions And whenever you want to go back to any of the working versions you can do that with the help of Git So this is how Git helps in code management So now let us take a look at the Git basic commands So if you want to create repositories lets say you want to create your local repository you just have to initialize it using Git init Or if there is an existing repository you can use Git clone If you want to make changes in your file you can use different commands You can use Git status to see whether a file is there in your index or not You can use Git add in order to add a file on your index And you can finally use Git commit in order to commit those changes that you have made Were syncing in repositories So you know that in Git we deal with two repositories the central and a local So you have to inform your local repository that which is your central repository that basically lies on a remote machine So for that we add origin We add the link of the central repository using this command git promote add origin And then if you want to pull all the files that are in the existing central repository use a git pull And then finally if you want to reflect your changes into the central repository you can use git push For parallel development we have got git branch It allows you to branch off from your main branch and you can work on different features on a completely isolated branch using git branch And then you can finally also merge all those changes in your production deployable branch which is usually the master branch using git merge And then we can also use git rebase Now this is a special kind of merge So it basically does the same thing as git merge only the commit workflow or the commit working tree looks a little bit different So youll know about that because well be using rebase in todays session So now let us take a look at the git workflows So basically the git workflows can be categorized into broadly three kinds So there is the centralized workflow where there is one central repository and only one working branch which is the master branch And there is the feature branch workflow where you have dedicated branches for each feature And then youve got git flow So well take a look at all of this and how to solve conflicts in each of these workflows So now let us talk about the centralized workflow So the centralized workflow uses a central repository to serve as a single point of entry for all changes to the project And there is only one default development branch and it is called the master And all changes are committed into this branch So this workflow does not require any branches besides the master So what the developers do they start by cloning the central repository into their local repository And in their own local copies of the project they will edit the files commit changes but you should know that these commits are stored locally Theyre completely isolated from the central repository And if the developers want the changes in the central repository theyll have to git push it So now lets say that we have got three people We have got Bob Alice and Jake And they are working on a project X So now lets say that Bob here makes the changes in the project commits it and then pushes it into the central repository So his changes will be published into the repository with his recent commits And now lets say that Alice is also working on the same thing and she wants to publish her changes in the central repository But since Bob and Alice change the same file in the same line there will be a conflict So let me show you how exactly does it happen and how to solve it So here I have created repositories for Bob and Alice So they are just in my system at different folders Since I have to show you the scenario I have to pretend to be two persons at one time So what Ill do Ill just click Git Bash here Now Im using Git for Windows so you just dont have to do anything You just click Git Bash here and it will open up the Git Bash shell And the same thing Im going to do for Alice over here So let me just adjust the screens so that you can see what Im doing in both of these Git Bash shells So I hope that you can see the screen over here So this is Bobs local repository shell that were using and this is for Alice So the first thing that you need to do you need to initialize your repository So for that you have to use Git Init And Ill do the same thing for Alice Its done and now what Im going to do I have already set up my central repository on GitHub So Ill just add the origin using Git Remote Add Origins So Ill do that for Bob Ill use this command Git Remote Add Origin And now you need to provide the link of your central repository that is on GitHub So Ill just go to my GitHub So you can find the link over here So you just copy it Paste it And Ill do the same thing again for Alice All right So now there are files that are existing in my central repository already So I want to pull those files So for that Ill just use this command Git Pull Origin Master So it has pulled all those files Ill do the same thing for Alice again So now if you see their repositories so this is Bobs repository It has pulled all the files from my central repository And this is the githidden folder This gets created when you initialize your repository specifically when we typed Git Init All right So now let us assume that Bob has made some changes So lets say this file over here So Im just taking very simple examples So basically there will be code here just so that you can just understand the concepts of conflict Im just using simple text files So lets say that Bob has made some change like this Saved it And now Bob wants to commit these changes So first Bob will check the Git status to see Sorry So Git status will show you whether a file has been added to the index or not So if it is in red it means that it has not been added to the index So for that well have to add this file So well use the command Git add and the name of our file So now if you check Git status So you can see that it is green now So it means that it has been added to the index It is there in the staging area and it is ready to be committed So now well use Git commit in order to commit this And also remember that we have to commit using a message So for Ill just pause this Bob changing And Eureka And Eureka So it is committed Now Bob wants to push it to the central repository So Ill use Git push origin master And its done So if you go to your central repository now So let me refresh this page So you can see Bobs commit over here So that means that this file has been changed in the central repository So now let us go to Alices local repository And lets say that Alice does not know that Bob has already made changes in the central repository and she is doing her work in her own local repository And she has changed the file something like this So well close it Now Alice will also do the same thing She will add the file And then she will commit the file So let me just keep it simple Ill just write Alice over here And now she would want to push it The same way that Bob has done Git push origin master And since its a centralized workflow there is only the master branch So you can see that there is an error that has been rejected The updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally So it means that something was changed in the central repository which Alices local repository doesnt contain And now it is centralized workflow And I dont want to mess around with my master branch because my master branch is supposed to always be and my master branch is always supposed to keep the production deployable code So instead of just pulling it directly Ill use rebase So what rebase will do is that it will always have the initial commits that will come from the central repository It will just add up my commits on top of that workflow or my working tree that shows all my commits So Ill show how it works So for that Ill not just pull it directly Ill use a different command Get pull rebase origin master So it is showing that there is a conflict in the content and it is an edurekatxt And even this message doesnt appear and youre confused where the conflict is You can do one thing Let me first clear the screen You can use git status to see where the conflicting file is So you can see that edurekatxt So in order to solve this conflict Ill use git merge tool So you can see it has opened up three files So this is the file that Bob has changed Was the original file and this is what Alice have changed Right So Alice can take a look and this is the head where her initial commit right now points to So she can decide whether to keep the changes or not And lets say that Alice wants to edit it She wants to solve the conflict And lets say that she decides that she wants to keep both the two lines So lets remove all that Save that file Again save and exit Save and exit Save and exit All right So now you can continue rebasing So for that you can use this command Okay Let me clear my screen so that you can see what Im typing So you can use this command git rebase continue So it has applied my last commit that I was trying to push it on to my central repository So now the merge conflict is solved and I should be an or lets say Alice should be successfully be able to push it to the central repository So lets try it Okay And the conflict is solved and it is successfully pushed onto the central repository So let me just show it to you So here is Alices commit So this is how you deal with conflicts when you are using a centralized workflow So I hope that this is clear So now let us talk about the feature branch workflow So if your team is comfortable with the centralized workflow but they want to streamline its collaboration efforts and it is definitely worth exploring the benefits of the feature branch workflow So what happens here is that you dedicate an isolated branch to each feature And because of this it is possible to initiate indepth discussions around the new additions before you try to integrate them into the official project So the core idea behind this feature branch workflow is that all feature development should take place in a dedicated branch instead of the master branch And this encapsulation actually makes it easier for multiple developers to work on a particular feature without disturbing the main code base because again Im telling you the master branch should always contain production deployable code So it also means that the master branch will never contain broken code And this is going to be a huge advantage when youre dealing with continuous integration environments So again let us consider the scenario This is a feature branch workflow So theyre all working on the features So lets say that Jake here is working on feature B and Alice and Bob are again working on feature A So again first Bob makes a new branch and he pushes that new branch where he has added some features and he has pushed it into the central repository And then again Alice wants to push it again And then the same things that she might have some changes that she might have done in the central repository So then there is an advantage of using the pull request So pull requests are a way to initiate discussions around a branch So they give other developers the opportunity to sign off on a feature branch before its get integrated into the official project So let me just show you an example of this again So open up this repositories again So this is Bobs repository So lets say that Bob wants to now branch off and work on his new feature So he just can use this command over here get branch and lets say his feature is called feature one So now lets check out the feature one So now Bob is in the feature one branch So lets say he wants to add something All right So just see what happens All right So just save and exit And now again Bob wants to add this file All right He will commit this file And now he would want to push this branch onto the central repository So for that hell just use the same command get push origin and the name of his branch And this will actually create a different branch in the central repository with the same name and it will serve as a remote tracking branch And it is done So if you go to the central repository now you can see that less than a minute ago there was a new branch here which is called the feature one So if you go check out this branch in GitHub you can see it has got this file along with the other files because it was actually branched off from the master with the latest commit where it contained all the files Right So now if Bob wants Alice to know that he has made some changes because now theyre working in a featured branch workflows so he will file a pull request So how to do that in GitHub you just have to go here Just click this button new pull request The base should be master branch and compare the feature one And then you can add some comments over here so you can just create and just lets say that Please check it out So if you want reviews on your branch whether you have done or developed the feature in the correct way or not you can actually add reviewers here and you can you can actually add reviewers here and you can actually also assign someone here So now since my GitHub only have me as a collaborator I dont have anyone else So you can add other people who are actually contributing onto this center repository And then finally you can click this button Oops All right There seems to be some internet issues with GitHub All right But the good part is that Im actually done with that You dont have to do anything after you have created that pull request So what will happen after that is that whoever you add as a reviewer so they will either get a mail of how you set it up So they get a mail and then you can also comment and therell be a back and forth discussion about what to change or not And finally you have to merge it when it has been set So when youre all the when the entire Im so sorry When your entire team is satisfied on the feature that you have worked on So someone will finally merge it onto the master branch So this was all about the feature branch So pull requests come in handy when to when you want to carry out discussions with your entire team So now let us talk about Git flow So Git flow workflow defines a strict branching model that is designed around the project release So this is somewhat more complicated than feature branch workflow but this provides a robust framework for managing larger projects So this is what the entire branching model kind of looks like So you dont have to worry even though it looks very complex this workflow does not add any new concepts or commands beyond whats required for the feature branch workflow Instead the difference is that it assigns very specific roles to different projects The difference is that it assigns very specific roles to different branches and defines how and when they should interact So in addition to feature branches it uses individual branches for preparing maintaining and recording releases And of course you also get to leverage all the benefits of feature branch workflow the pull requests the isolated experience experiments that you do on your feature branches and more efficient collaboration So how does it work So the Git flow workflow uses a central repository as a communication hub for all developers just like all other workflows And the developers again work locally and push branches onto the central repository So the only difference is the branch structure of the project So instead of a single master branch so this workflow uses two branches to record the history of the project So the master branch here actually stores the official release history and then develop branch that serves as an integration branch for features And it is very convenient to tag all the commits in the master branch as different versions So here you have tagged it as version 10 101 then 110 something like this So whatever naming scheme that you are comfortable with So you have got feature branches So there are two feature branches mostly One is there which majorly focuses on the coming release And the other needs to be worked on for a coming release or a future release So when a feature is complete it gets merged back to the develop branch And feature branch should never interact directly with the master So feature branches combined with develop branch for all intended purposes to the feature branch workflow but the git workflow does not stop there So once develop has acquired enough features for a release or lets say a release date is coming up so what do you do You fork a release branch off to develop And creating this branch starts the next release cycle So no new features can be added at this point So you can only do bug fixes and hot fixes and patching up things And once it is ready to ship the release gets merged onto the master And tagged with the version number So this is how git flow works So obviously youll also find merge conflicts here But it is very easy to fix because it is more in a structured way And when you have a lot of people working on a particular application especially larger applications you can use git flow for that And in most of the companies people use git flow So all you have to do you have to create feature branches you have to create a develop branch and you have to follow the git flow So just flow with the git flow And so here are the different workflows I hope that you have understood something you have learned something new And I have shown you in a very bare minimum ways just so that you can get the concepts So all right so if you have any questions you can leave it on the comment section below And Im very glad to announce that Edureka has finally launched their DevOps

            "Reference summary for testing sample 309: This is the first farm on Mars Okay technically its not on Mars Its Wyoming So close enough Anyway it could be on Mars Because this is one of the worlds most advanced indoor farms And it could be the future of farming right here on Earth With vertical farming you can start with a building roughly the size of a Costco grow your crops up and down instead of around you on the floor ditch the pesticides recycle the water and you can grow pretty much anywhere anytime Why do this Well look at this Its all of the farmland in the world All of that used to be nature It is probably one of the most defining acts of humanity We literally changed the ecosystem of the entire planet in order to meet our dietary needs Plants today produce roughly what they produced 10 20 years ago Weve just managed to pack more of them into a field And there is a limit to that type of yield gain Our job is to build the farms that unlock nutrition for everyone on a scale that no ones ever seen And the only way we can do that now is by growing indoors Indoors Dont you need sunlight and rain to grow the worlds food Maybe not This is Hard Reset a series about rebuilding our world from scratch So pods are where we do almost all of our environmental research This is where we understand what drives flavor what drives appearance what drives yield in all of the different crops that we grow Why would we want to farm vertically Well theres a reason that libraries dont spread their books all over the floor They stack them up on shelves so that they can stack a lot of books in a small footprint Vertical farms do the same thing for agriculture And while vertical farms are not new companies like Plenty are leading the charge at making them mainstream Okay this is Nates story Plenty So going vertical allows us to put a lot more product in a single spot It allows us to circulate Aries or administer Lighties It allows us to have massive growing plants We can condense about 700 acres of farmland into the size of a big box retail store And we harvest 365 days a year We are able to condense the growth cycle to about 10 days for a lot of our products which is about a 700 increase in yield We are doing that all while saving about a million gallons of water per week and using about 1 of the land compared to traditional farming In an indoor farm we put water in the roots So when they take the water up they transpire that water And then that water gets sucked into our air handling units We condense it all and put it right back in the system So 99 of the water thats transpired in the field and lost is captured and recirculated in our farms We have you know strawberries in another space Weve got an upstairs space devoted to tomatoes Overall weve got over 50 different you know discrete spaces that we use to do these tests Historically vertical farming has been too expensive and too inefficient to make it a better option than traditional farming But thats all changing now as these technologies drop in price Humanity is on that cost curve right now We just dont realize it Were riding this cost curve down to a future where almost anything is possible in an extremely controlled environment Thats not to say one of these vertical farms is cheap A new facility can cost 100 million to install but the cost of each component is plummeting as industries like solar and robotics are flourishing But the surprising technology thats helped make this possible is LEDs What vertical farms use to replicate the sun Lets break that down Our system is just a system of energy transfers And our ability to manage the efficiency of those energy transfers in some way or another is what makes us economical or noneconomical as a business Sounds crazy but like most everything in the world right like we can only save our species if it makes economic sense You know life and death Lets make sure that we can afford it right Right Nate gets it Basically an LEDs efficiency comes down to how little loss there is between the grids electricity and the amount of light it puts out Then how much light is actually absorbed and used by the plant We think about LEDs as like the point of major energy loss in the system Were taking electrons and converting them into photons And thanks to all your TV and cell phone and light bulb buying LED technology has gotten really really efficient And Plenty is getting really good at putting out the kind of light that actually results in plant growth and plant flavor LEDs have just been going down down down in price and up up up in efficiency And our understanding of what makes a good photon versus a bad photon at the plant level has been going up up up as weve been researching and working Were really kind of transitioning into a world where humans and machines are partnering together in better and better ways to make farming awesome Plenty is not vaporware Its already on the market Their first farm in the San Francisco Bay Area has produce available at local stores today Its premium price but its not unaffordable Plenty is banking on their produce being better and more flavorful than produce from traditional farms What we can do with nutrients and lights is we can change the flavor profile of our plants So things like a blue light can make a more crispy crunch on a plant like our kale The kale is like nothing like a kale you would think of Its like soft Its kind of sweet Its crunchy So I make a pesto out of it that I really love I sampled Plentys products and theyre not wrong The baby arugula baby kale and mizuna mixes all have a ton of flavor And that kale pesto that Shereen mentioned So good And because farms like Plenty use a tremendous amount of automation these plants have actually never even been touched by human hands When you grow things outside the elements are much more unpredictable If you grow indoors you can control a lot of those factors in ways that arent accessible to outdoor growers And the result is that our produce can be hundreds of times cleaner Plenty doesnt need to use pesticides because there are no bugs Its produce doesnt have bird poop on it because why would you put birds inside a warehouse It results in a product thats so clean you dont need to wash it And thats a huge step forward for human health and safety Faster unhealthy food dominates peoples diets but thats partially because alternative produce for most is kind of gross Could be the best tasting lettuce and tomato hamburger ever So globally we eat about one third of the fresh fruits and vegetables that we should be consuming Thats a huge problem Thats why we see the rise of heart disease and diabetes and all of these different things in places where people used to just struggle to get enough calories right And what weve done in the last really like 50 years is weve figured out how to trick our bodies into wanting to eat the wrong things Humanity is trapped in our addiction to those calories And we dont have the land or the resources or the ability to compensate with high nutrition food Most produce has been packed up and shipped off to another country or transported across state lines via trucks and trains Thats not great for the environment and it also sucks for the flavor of your produce Many products like tomatoes are like designed for durability because they got to be shipped across the country in these like massive trucks and not for flavor So our products can last longer on shelves because theyre not spending three or four days on a truck Were able to concentrate on quality over the ability to ship And so this is in a lot of ways the democratization of flavor Right now we are really focused on building our facility in Compton Were in the middle of construction and hoping to open that facility in the next year or so Compton is a food desert So were bringing jobs to communities that really are looking for investment in people These arent seasonal jobs Theyre fulltime jobs 365 days a year at living wages Being able to grow in communities anywhere means that we will be able to offer that produce to places that traditionally havent had access I mean thats what we can do is we can create local farms everywhere With their San Francisco and Compton facilities plenty will only be growing leafy greens and shorter plants Tall crops like wheat or corn dont make much sense to farm vertically But that may all change in the decades to come So picture a scenario where we got rid of all the traditional farms and replaced them with just vertical farms Fresh produce could be grown in arid places like Cairo and Phoenix or frigid places like Helsinki and Calgary Every place in the world would be able to grow the same crops grown in California and Tuscany How would that change diets and cuisines and our impact on the environment The businesses and lives of people associated with traditional farming would be severely disrupted Farming communities would lose their identities But does that outweigh the potential benefits That hard reset is one where the vast majority of our food is grown indoors Its grown in a completely protected environment under artificial light You know given exactly the nutrients it needs its hyperproductive its in the cities or in the regions where the people live And humanity is fully untethered from the environment in terms of how our population grows We can go anywhere and grow these crops in almost any conditions now We can expand kind of this human consciousness of flavor in ways that were never possible when we were seasonally locked into production cycles This is the kind of technology and efficiency well need with the Artemis base on the moon and eventually on Mars But its also kind of what we need here on Earth We can give the world back a lot We can give the world back land We can give back the jungles of Borneo to the orangutan We can give back the Amazon to the planet We can give back the Midwest to the buffalo We can give back the things that weve taken And we can be a lot less extractive\n",
            "Reference summary for testing sample 740:  Welcome back Aliens My name is Abin Reddy and lets continue with this series on JavaScript Now in this video well talk about arithmetic operators Now see when you talk about a language or you talk about software you perform some operations right Now it can be calculations it can be logical operations but here lets focus on calculations and we do that a lot on computers as well right So lets say if you want to add two numbers you want to subtract two numbers you want to find a division of a number you can do that and for it you need to use certain operators and the thing is in the earlier videos we have talked about most of them but still you know just to complete that topic lets talk about In fact once we reach to the end of the video well talk about some important operators and some tricky parts So lets get started So what well do is I will create a variable here num and usually the value of number will be lets say one and I want to perform some addition subtraction multiplication division just to show you that So what I will do here is I will take another number here which is result and with this number I will perform that operation or maybe just to make it more effective like lets take some other numbers so that we can perform all the required operations lets say four and two and we know because what happens when you use these simple numbers easy to calculate at least in our mind So what I will do is I will say num one plus num two and we know it right this is addition operator So well print it and well print result okay this is the addition of two numbers and then well print lets run this code and lets see what happens if you run this code you got six that is that is good and now I want to find the subtraction its very simple so just we are trying to complete that as soon as possible because its very simple in fact in the earlier video we also talked about what happens when you have different types of data and when you apply these operators but as of now just to keep it simple we are going for numbers right we can actually also perform the division operator when you divide you can say we got two in fact you can also divide the number by zero which will give you infinity you can also divide the number by a string it will give you a nan you can you can try those things right but then we know what is addition subtraction division can you multiply yes with the help of this hash trick symbol and if you run this code we got eight so basic operation is very easy right what about if you want to find a remainder so in this case well use a percentage operator so lets try and we should get zero right so four divided by two and the remainder is zero so we can try with other numbers as well lets say if you have a number is five and then if you find a remainder by doing that with two you will get one okay this is working so no issues with this thing right and then if you have two strings I mean string and a string it will give you concatenation right but what happens example lets say the num one is not actually a number but its a boolean value true and num two is also true and the operation you want to perform here is addition now what will happen pause this video go to comment section and type the answer what do you think what is the answer here now logically it can be true because if you know the concept of complex logical operations so when you have two truths it might be something like that or it might be nan because you cant add boolean values lets try what happens I hope you have answered that in the comment section we got two why why we got two here thats weird so its actually very simple remember when we talked about truthy value and falsy values whenever you have a true and if you try to convert that because we are using a plus operator here right now type conversion it says okay when you have a plus operator and on both the side you have boolean values let me convert them for you so this number will be converted into numbers and the first number so zero is false so one is true and thats why we got two right so one plus one is two very simple okay this works now whatever what I want to do is let me just remove result for time being and let me also remove num two lets only focus on num one here and when you have only one num lets go with num and here let me print num okay lets go with number four again and let me run this code and you can see we got four let me just clear the screen now what I will do is I will just add this number by itself so what I will do is I will say num is equal to num plus two so what Im doing is Im taking that number four Im adding two so this makes sense right so it should give you six because here what we are doing is we are taking the value of num which is four four plus two is six then it will assign thats how it goes so first it will try to solve this expression okay this is the expression what is the expression whenever you have something which will be getting resolved to a value it is expression example num plus two is expression five plus two is expression high is an expression five is an expression because were going to assign five to a number so here we are saying num plus two is an expression which will be assigned to num which is six in this case and you got the answer now when you want to add a number by itself example we are adding num by two right so we can use a shorthand so instead of using this syntax let me just comment this here so we can use double slash to comment a code and then we can use shortcut so we can say we want to add num itself so we can say num plus so we want to add num itself with two okay this is this is called shorthand operators so instead of using this syntax we can use this so we are saying we want to add num by itself plus two lets try and it worked right it worked so we can also do that with the number one so lets say if you want to do this operation which is num equal to num plus one in this case we can say num plus equal to one so this should also work we should get five but specifically when you have only one you can actually use a special operator which is called num plus plus plus plus operator so it also means increment so if num is five it will give you six if num is six it will give you seven so num plus plus is an increment and thats why if you know theres a language called c and c plus plus c was the initial version c plus plus is the next increment of c right so thats why they went with c plus plus name oh we have not seen the output yet it still works right so instead of using num equal to num plus one we can say num plus plus okay so this is how you can increment what about if you want to do this num equal to num minus one any guess you guessed it right we can use num minus minus right and this works so plus plus will increment minus minus will decrement in fact the fun part is you can actually use plus plus at the start so you can either say num plus plus or you can say plus plus num both will give you the same answer in this case okay why i said in this case actually the thing is they both have different names this is called this syntax which we are using here is called pre increment and when you say num plus plus this is called post increment in fact there should be a separate video talking about these things but lets try to do that here itself so we got num plus plus and we got plus plus num one is pre increment and one is post increment whats the difference see in both this case example even if you try this syntax or this syntax it will ultimately give you the next iteration right so what im doing is i will run this code what is your guess what will be the output it should be six right because here we are saying plus plus num which will make this number four to five so this is five here and at this point we are saying num plus plus it will make it six so if i run this code we got six so this is working right but we still dont know the difference between pre increment and post increment let me do that oh before even before going ahead what if you have minus minus num and num minus minus what it will be called pre decrement post decrement right so name changes but just to understand the difference between this two lets go with this example here so what i will do now is let me get another variable which is x equal to and i will say x plus plus okay so now what we are doing is we are incrementing num that makes sense and then we are assigning the value to x so this is an expression which will give you a value and that value we are assigning to x and then let me print x here actually let me print both let me print x and then let me also print num and lets see whats the difference between these two numbers so what do you think even before running this code what is your guess and please also mention the timeline okay because the problem is in this video i have asked you for so many questions to answer that in the comment section so what you can do is for different answer you can give a timeline this at this point this is the answer so that it will be helpful for others to actually know what youre thinking so what sometimes you what happens you know when when you are learning something new and then if everyone is getting the right answer youre getting the wrong answer you feel bad but what if everyone is getting the wrong answer and youre getting the right answer you feel good what if everyone is getting wrong answer you feel way better because not everyone knows about it its a its a good feeling okay so come back so here we are doing that and let me see what happens before that i will clear the screen and run and you can see we got four and five so we got here four oh thats weird why we got four see num five makes sense because we are incrementing it why we got four here its because this num plus plus is called post increment now what this post increment means so post increment just means that it will first fetch the value then it will assign the value so basically we have two operations here increment and assignment so we are assigning the value to x right and then we are also incrementing it which will happen first since this is post increment it will first assign the value then it will increment so before increment whats the value of num its so four will be assigned to x and then it will increment okay and thats why we got four for x and five for num what will happen when you do this now this time we are not doing post increment we are doing pre increment now you should be able to guess it right it should be five and five now why five five is because we are first incrementing it pre increment right pre so it is first incrementing it making it the value of five and then assigning to x which is five in this case so thats the difference between pre increment and post increment okay so before ending the video we have something more lets say i have this number four and i want to find a cube of this number how do you find a cube of a number its very simple let me say let result equal to you can say num into num into num so thats how you can find a cube of a number right the other way you can do is let me just run this code first let me just print the value in the console and lets see what happens you can see we got 64 but what if i want to do something else so we got a math class math interface of course well talk about class interface later but as of now we got something inbuilt so lets imagine we have inbuilt function called math that power and in this you can pass two parameters four comma three now what is four the actual value and then three is cube or if you want to find a square you will say two so this is actually a power so when you say three you are finding four raised to three which is four power three and thats why its a power power right so if you go over it it will say its a function or a method returns a value of a base expression x is the base value and y is the exponent value right so this you can use this and it will give the same answer right but then a new version which is es6 we got something new and that is using double star or double asteris so when you use single asterisk it is multiplication double asterisk means power and you can say we got the same answer if you want to find a square you can do that if you want to find four raised to four you can do that so thats with the help of the asterisk symbol double asterisk symbol so thats it from this video i hope you enjoyed let me in the comment section and do other videos bye\n",
            "Reference summary for testing sample 578: Im drawing a graph Doesnt it look cool But I didnt know how it worked until I watched StackQuest Hello and welcome to StackQuest StackQuest is brought to you by the friendly folks in the genetics department at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Today were going to be talking about TSNE or TISNE To be honest I dont actually know how its pronounced but its going to be clearly explained I know that bet Also this StackQuest is by request A couple of people put it in the comments below and I got a couple of emails from other people so Im doing it because you guys want it Here it goes If youre watching this StackQuest chances are youve seen an example of a TSNE graph before What TSNE does is it takes a high dimensional data set and reduces it to a low dimensional graph that retains a lot of the original information If youre not familiar with those terms of taking a high dimensional data set and reducing it to a low dimensional graph you might want to watch the StackQuest for PCA because I explain what that means in that video Heres a basic 2D scatter plot Lets do a walkthrough of how TSNE would transform this graph into a flat one dimensional plot on a number line Im going to use this super simple example to explain the concepts behind TSNE so that when you see it applied to a much larger data set a much more complex data set youll still know how that graph was drawn Note if we just projected the data onto one of the axes we just get a big mess that doesnt preserve the original clustering If we projected onto the yaxis instead of two distinct clusters we just see a mishmash And the same thing happens if we just project the data onto the xaxis What TSNE does is find a way to project data into a low dimensional space in this case the one dimensional number line so that the clustering in the high dimensional space in this case the two dimensional scatter plot is preserved So lets step through the basic ideas of how TSNE does this Well start with the original scatter plot Then well put the points on the number line in a random order From here on out TSNE moves these points a little bit at a time until it has clustered them Lets figure out where to move this first point Should it move a little to the left or a little to the right Because it is part of this cluster in the two dimensional scatter plot it wants to move closer to these points But at the same time these points are far away in the scatter plot so they push back These points attract while these points repel In this case the attraction is strongest so the point moves a little to the right Bam Now lets move this point a little bit These points attract because they are close to each other in the two dimensional scatter plot And this point repels a little bit because it is far from the point in the two dimensional scatter plot So it moves a little closer to the other orange points Double bam At each step a point on the line is attracted to points it is near in the scatter plot and repelled by points it is far from Triple bam Now that weve seen what TSNE tries to do lets dive into the nitty gritty details of how it does what it does Step 1 determine the similarity of all the points in the scatter plot For this example lets focus on determining the similarities between this point and all of the other points First measure the distance between two points Then plot that distance on a normal curve that is centered on the point of interest Lastly draw a line from the point to the curve The length of that line is the unscaled similarity I made that terminology up but it will make sense in just a bit so hold on Now we calculate the unscaled similarity for this pair of points Now we calculate the unscaled similarity for this pair of points And now we calculate the unscaled similarity for this pair of points Etc etc etc Using a normal distribution means that distant points have very low similarity values and close points have high similarity values Ultimately we measure the distances between all of the points and the point of interest Then plot them on a normal curve And then measure the distances from the points to the curve to get the unscaled similarity scores with respect to the point of interest The next step is to scale the unscaled similarities so that they add up to 1 Ummm why do the similarity scores need to add up to 1 It has to do with something I didnt tell you earlier And to illustrate the concept I need to add a cluster that is half as dense as the others The width of the normal curve depends on the density of data near the point of interest Less dense regions have wider curves So if these points have half the density as these points and this curve is half as wide as this curve then scaling the similarity scores will make them the same for both clusters Heres an example where Ive worked out the math This curve has a standard deviation equal to 1 These are the unscaled similarity values This curve has a standard deviation equal to 2 These points are twice as far from the middle The unscaled similarity values are half of the other ones To scale the similarity scores so that they sum to 1 you take a score and you divide it by the sum of all the scores That equals the scaled score Heres how the math works out when the distribution has a standard deviation equals to 1 We get 082 and 018 as the scaled similarity scores And heres the math for when everything is spread out twice as much We get 082 and 018 The similarity scores on top are equal to the similarity scores below Theyre the same That implies that the scaled similarity scores for this relatively tight cluster are the same for this relatively loose cluster The reality is a little more complicated but only slightly TSNE has a perplexity parameter equal to the expected density around each point And that comes into play but these clusters are still more similar than you might expect Now back to the original scatter plot Weve calculated similarity scores for this point Now we do it for this point And we do it for all the points One last thing and the scatter plot will be all set with similarity scores Because the width of the distribution is based on the density of the surrounding data points the similarity score for this node might not be the same as the similarity to this node So TSNE just averages the two similarity scores from the two directions No big deal Ultimately you end up with a matrix of similarity scores Each row and column represents the similarity scores calculated from that point of interest Red equals high similarity and white equals low similarity Ive drawn the similarity from a point of interest to itself as dark red However it doesnt really make sense to say that a point is similar to itself because that doesnt help the clustering So TSNE actually defines that similarity as zero Hooray Were done calculating similarity scores for the scatter plot Now we randomly project the data onto the number line and calculate similarity scores for the points on the number line Just like before that means picking a point measuring a distance and lastly drawing a line from the point to a curve However this time were using a Tdistribution A Tdistribution is a lot like a normal distribution except the T isnt as tall in the middle and the tails are taller on the ends The Tdistribution is the T in TSNE Well talk about why the Tdistribution is used in a little bit So using a Tdistribution we calculate unscaled similarity scores for all the points and then scale them like before Like before we end up with a matrix of similarity scores but this matrix is a mess compared to the original matrix The goal of moving this point is we want to make this row look like this row TSNE moves the points a little bit at a time and at each step it chooses a direction that makes the matrix on the left more like the matrix on the right It uses small steps because its a little bit like a chess game and cant be solved all at once Instead it goes one move at a time Bam Now to finally tell you why the Tdistribution is used Without it the clusters would all clump up in the middle and be harder to see Triple bam And now we know how TSNE works Ive used a really simple example here but the concepts are the exact same for more complicated datasets Hooray Weve made it to the end of another exciting StatQuest If you like this StatQuest and want to see more like it please subscribe And if you have any ideas for future StatQuests just put them in the comments below Until next time quest on\n",

sent across Europe and North Africa in order for Rome to expand more and more Their southern border was in North Africa at the beginning of the Sahara Desert This arid mostly uninhabitable place assured a natural border and defense between other civilizations But also it stopped the Roman expansion Little is known about Roman expeditions that existed beyond this point However the Romans had a few attempts on exploring deeper into the African continent SubSaharan Africa was explored by Roman expeditions between 19 BC and 19 AD most likely in an effort to locate the sources of valuable trade goods and establish routes to bring them to the seaports on the coast of North Africa thereby minimizing disruption in trade caused by conflicts among indigenous tribes and kingdoms Most of these expeditions began as military campaigns While the last one may have been initiated in the interests of trade relations but the purpose of all of them seems to have been in the interests of expanding

the interior to the three great Roman centers on the North African coast Leptis Magna Oweya and Sabratha But the desire for even more goods and direct access to them prompted Roman excursions to the SubSaharan regions The five expeditions were in 19 BC and in 41 50 70 and 90 AD The cultural impact of the Roman expeditions on the SubSaharan cultures in fact is still debated among scholars Trade among the different kingdoms and tribes of Africa was already well established by the time the Phoenicians founded Carthage 332 BCE The overland trade routes connections and seaports had been used by African merchants for centuries and once the Carthaginians gained a foothold in North Africa contributed to the wealth prestige and power of their central city and others in the region Trade centers were already established on the North African coast by the seminomadic or nomadic Berber tribes of the region who traded with each other and may have exported goods elsewhere After 30 BCE following the death of Cleopatra VII Rome took Egypt and added it to its North African holdings which was a very important grain supply to Rome The empire was supplemented through the trade at the cities of Reggio and Tripolitania Rome had established trade relations with the other kingdoms as well From West Africa other traders also brought their items towards Tripolitania but these trade routes were often disrupted by conflicts between kingdoms or different tribes It has been suggested that one of the tribes involved in this regions trade were the Garamantes though this claim has been challenged It is not known if the Garamantes were directly involved in trade coming from West Africa However its possible that they interrupted trade through raids on caravans which sparked a response from Rome leading to the first of Roman expeditions Lucius Cornelius Babus 1st century BC was proconsul of Africa in 19 BCE when he was ordered by Augustus Caesar to put down the Garamantes who were in some way interfering with Roman interests in the Pheasant region of Libya Babus led 10000 legionaries from Sabrafa against the Berber tribe and conquered them Afterward and perhaps on his own initiative or on orders he sent a number of his men onward to explore the land of lions which lay on the other side of the Hagar mountains in the central Sahara region Babus men returned with the report of a large body of water now thought to be the Niger River and Roman coins and other artifacts have been found in the region supporting the claim that Babus men crossed the mountains and explored the region This evidence is debated Another expedition was led by Paulinus In the course of this campaign in 41 CE Paulinus led his men over the Atlas Mountains in southern Mauritania He reached the summit of the mountains after a 10day march and according to Pliny then traveled a significant distance down through the plains to explore along a river referred to as Gir and then the area around the Daris River modern Senegal River Evidence for Roman presence in this region comes from artifacts and coins discovered there many in and around the city of Akzujd In 50 AD one Septimus Flaccus led an expedition from Leptis Magna against a rebellious tribe which was disrupting trade in the region controlled by the socalled Garamantes Who Flaccus was is equally unclear as he is not identified with any legion and no earlier mention is made of him Some scholars have suggested that the geographer Ptolemy who wrote the account of Flaccus expedition based on an earlier source got his name wrong Probably this was the case or he may have omitted information he felt was unnecessary Flaccus must have had some military background however in order to command a force that led them successfully against whatever group of people was causing the problem in the southern regions Usually military commanders were sent in military expeditions This possible general marched into Garamantes territory and subdued them He then travelled on over the Tibesti Mountains and into the land known as Agassimba which was north of a great body of water known as the Lake of Hippopotamus and Rhinoceros This lake has been identified as Lake Chad Flaccus expedition is the first one known to have interacted with the populace of this region at any length but no details are available on what this contact consisted of Scholars agree that Agassimba was to the north of Lake Chad but as the lake was much larger at the time precisely where it was how large the region and who lived there is unknown It is assumed it was controlled by the Garamantes However Festus concluded business with the Garamantes They seem to have been on friendly terms with Rome 20 years later when one Julius Maternus led an expedition into their territories The problem with sources regarding this expedition is that it is unclear who Maternus was and what position diplomat merchant or military commander he held There is no mention of Maternus before or after this expedition and details of the excursion itself seem to support any of the three possibilities He traveled in the company of the Garamanian king and so as a diplomat could have been forging better political relations as a merchant forging better trade relations as a general helping the king to put down rebellious subjects which would have benefited them both Anyway whoever he was and whatever position he held Maternus success seems to have been based on the reports of the expeditions which went before him Like Flaccus he crossed the Tibesti Mountains and explored Agassimba and like Festus and Babus explored the region around the Niger River However an expedition was also sent to go find to sources of the Nile and went beyond the Sedan All these expeditions were supported by legionnaires and had mainly a commercial purpose Only the one conducted by the emperor Nero seemed to be a preparative for the conquest of Ethiopia or Nubia In 1662 AD two legionnaires explored the source of the Nile One of the main objectives of the exploration was to locate and obtain gold using camels to transport it over land back to Roman provinces in the Mediterranean coast Sea voyages between Rome and North Africa conversely could be completed in less than a month and so were much more lucrative and further safer for both investors and crew Although there is no defining document explicitly stating why the overland expeditions were launched it is reasonable to conclude based on the nature of the military campaigns and the Roman independence on African goods why the Romans didnt expand deeper into Africa is because of a multitude of reasons But this is a topic for another video Again a big thank you to our sponsor Rise of Kingdoms Also a new

            "Reference summary for testing sample 545: So as we have spoken earlier we need a way to represent complex data types in C So lets say we talk about a single point in threedimensional space It has an int x int y and int z So we need a way to represent all three of them together as a single block All three put together represents a point in space So we need to have a data type lets say point which says a single point consists of x y and zaxis Similarly lets have another example that you can see on your screen Its a coordinate system Any address on Earth is represented by a latitude and a longitude A latitude is a floating point number followed by a character which says whether its north south east or west Similarly the longitude also is a floating point number followed by the direction So now all these four put together tells you the coordinates of a particular point on Earth So if youre going to write a program in C which is going to store the coordinates of a particular location then its simpler to have a single block called coordinates instead of having four different variables To do that we can define all the four variables within a single structure So in C a structure is a collection of multiple variables of different types They can be of the same type too but the whole idea is youre trying to store everything as a structure So most of the time theyre all of different types Structures are used to basically create userdefined data types Like you can see here we wanted a new data type called coordinate So we created a structure called structcoord Then within that we have said that the coordinate consists of a latitude a float longitude a character which is latitude underscore direction and another character longitude underscore direction So what you see here is a syntax for defining a structure in C You have the keyword struct followed by the name of the structure that you want to give curly braces Then you can have all the variables that belong to the particular structure And finally you close the curly braces and a semicolon So now weve defined a userdefined data type called structcoord Now we shall go ahead and see how were going to use this structure How do we access its members How do we copy data to it And so on So like I said we have now declared a userdefined data type and its called structcoord So before we can start using it we have to first declare a variable of that type To declare a variable of any type is simple So in this case you just say structcoord and then c1 So now we have a variable c1 which is of the type structcoord So c1 itself consists of four individual variables So within c1 you have a float latitude you have a character latitude underscore direction you have a float longitude and you have a char longitude underscore direction To initialize the structure c1 you say c1 equal to curly braces and values for all the four members which are part of the structure So 2717 becomes the latitude The letter n is the latitude underscore direction 7804 is the longitude And the letter e is longitude underscore direction Okay so now that we have initialized the variable 2 how do we access each individual member in the structure To access the members of a structure we use the dot operator So you say variable name dot member name So in this case the variable name is c1 the member name is latitude So I say c1 dot latitude equal to 2717 Or if I want to print the latitude on the screen I can just say printf percentage d c1 dot latitude But latitude is float so youll say percentage f Similarly you say printf percentage c c1 dot lat underscore direction Simple So you say variable name dot member name Also just so we can have basic variables within a structure you can have other structures also within structures These are called nested structures So lets say I have another structure in my program I can make that structure part of a new structure that Im going to declare to We shall see how were going to do that And finally now that weve declared a new data type every data type has a size We know that integers are generally 4 bytes a character is 1 byte So what is the size of a structure The size of a structure is basically the sum of all of its members But the size of a structure is not simply the sum It may sometimes be greater than the sum of all of its members And the next slide we shall see why Before that were going to take another simple example of using structures and write a program for the same So lets take another real life example When we want to represent a person a person consists of a first name and a last name Its just not a name alone right So youre talking about the name of a person it can be first name last name or first name middle name last name So for this example were going to assume that a person has a first name and a last name So how do we represent that in C So first lets just include stdioh Now were going to define a new data type called name struct name Now the name itself consists of two parts the first name and the last name So youre going to say char first name size 50 so you have up to 50 characters char last name 50 Finally close this So thats our structure Generally you define structures outside of any function because its a data type and you can use the data type anywhere But once youve defined the function you can have variables of that Once youve defined the structure you can have variables of the structure within any function and that variable becomes local to that function So lets have int main Now I want to store the name of a student so lets declare a variable of the type name So I say struct name student So now we want the user to enter his or her name and were going to store it in the variable student Printf enter your first name The first name is a character array or like we say its a string You can of course use scanf to accept strings from the user but a better way to accept strings is use the getAs function As scanf with s has some issues you cannot accept strings with spaces in it getAs is a simpler one so you say getAs And now we want to accept the first name so you say studentfname Next you want the last name so printf Enter your last name getAs studentlname Now finally before we exit the program we want to see if weve stored the name correctly Made a mistake here So lets print both the values so printf Now remember that to print a structure C does not understand what type is that structure so you can access only each member of the structure So in C if you want to print a structure you cannot print it as it is You can only print every member individually Just the way we had to accept the first name separately and store it in first name accept the last name then store it in last name Similarly when Im printing it I can print just one member at a time I cannot just say printf some special keyword and give just the structure name as student So if I have to print the first name and the last name of the student I have to say printf first name percentage s studentfname Similarly printf last name percentage s studentlastname Finally system pause return zero Lets try and run this program Compile turn on the warnings run enter your first name Im going to say hello enter your last name Im going to say world first name hello last name world So of course for this example we did not require a structure We could have just had two different variables called charfname and charlname and stored it But once weve made it into a structure its very easy for us to understand when we look at the variable student we know were going to store the name of a student And the name of a student comes of two parts which is a first name and a last name So now your program becomes a lot more structured and is very easy to represent complex data like this So now were going to talk about structure padding due to which the size of a particular structure can be more than just the sum of its members Now we shall see why One of the main issues is many processors expect the memory allocated for a particular variable to be byte aligned What I mean by byte aligned is that lets say a variable takes up four bytes like an integer Then the processor expects that variable to sit at a four byte boundary So which means that variable can sit at the byte number 5004 or 5008 or 5012 and so on It cannot be assigned the address 5003 or 5002 because thats not four byte aligned But a character which is one byte can sit anywhere in memory Similarly a double which may be eight bytes would have to be eight byte aligned So now lets see how this property is going to affect the size of our structure So lets say this is my memory And I want to store char ch Because a character takes up just one byte I can store it anywhere in memory So I can store ch at the address 5001 Now lets say I want int num Integer takes up four bytes So I need four bytes in memory The starting address for this four bytes has to be four byte aligned So this has to be either 5004 5008 or a multiple of four So now what happens when we apply the same rule to a structure When the individual variables are no problems integer takes up four bytes It doesnt matter where memory is going to sit I need the address whenever I want it But it can sit anywhere in memory and its going to assign four bytes to it Now lets try to put these two fields within a structure So if I say struct dummy So I have a structure dummy And I have two variables one of the type char and other of the type int So now when I say struct dummy d1 what happens Im going to first erase this So when we declare a structure the space for the structure and the space for all the members within a structure I allocate it one after the other So normally what you would end up doing is in d1 you start d1 here lets say Our character is one byte and integer is four bytes So we need five bytes So allocate to five bytes So d1ch is the first byte And then d1num is the next four bytes So d1 starts here ch or chasch is the first member thats stored here Then num or int num is the second member that is stored here Its simple right So we have three members the third member here fourth member and so on But now lets say if d1ch was at address 5000 ch is the type chasch it can sit anywhere in memory thats okay Which would mean d1num would start at address 5001 But num being an integer it cannot start at address 5001 Like I said earlier it has to be four byte aligned That means after 5000 the next byte it can sit at is 5004 So this is 5004 This is 5001 this is 5002 this is 5003 this is 5004 So you have 5004 here So your d1num has to start at 5004 and then it will occupy four bytes after this point So you have 5005 6007 So d1num is going to occupy these four bytes And d1ch is occupying this byte So what happens to these three bytes These three bytes are wasted And the compiler uses these three bytes to pad the structure so that all the other members are byte aligned So this is called structure padding So now the size of the structure is not 4 plus 1 5 but its 4 plus 1 plus 3 Thats eight bytes So size of the entire structure is eight bytes Knowing such information is useful to us because once we know about structure padding its easier for us to redesign or rewrite the structure so that we use up less space Now instead of writing it like this if youd written the structure as struct dummy int num first and then charsiech So first it will allocate space for the integer num So it can start anywhere in memory right now It will align to four bytes of course So it will allocate space for the integer num which is four bytes And then it will allocate space for charsiech For a character which is one byte it doesnt matter We can start it anywhere This will be ch This will be num So this is four bytes and this is one byte totally eight bytes But then in this case too instead of five bytes the structure is going to take up eight bytes This is because after the charsiech the last three bytes are also going to be used up This is because the entire structure or the end of the structure is also padded based on the size of the largest member The size of the largest member here is four bytes which is for num So the end of the structure also has to be four byte aligned So now once we have a character we still have to assign three more bytes to make it four byte aligned So its going to pad three more bytes making the entire structure eight bytes So in this case which is two variables no matter how we interchange the order the size is going to occupy will remain the same But in a lot of other cases once we are aware of structure padding we can rearrange the members to minimize the effect of structure padding The simplest thing to do to minimize the effect of structure padding is to arrange the members in descending order So lets say I have int num double x and then float f Lets say what happens This is four bytes then this is eight bytes Youre going to use a four bytes for padding Then this is four bytes So weve taken up four bytes We dont have to bother about padding So youve taken up four four eight 16 20 And the end of the structure has all should also be eight byte aligned because the largest member is eight bytes So youre going to have again the four bytes of padding So lets say we had stored the members in the opposite order or a different order So I first stored double double x then I have a float f and int Now now lets see what happens Double x takes up eight bytes and the float f four bytes No padding required because in a four byte boundary int num four bytes Again its in a four byte boundary Total 12 16 Total is 16 bytes So no padding required at the end of the structure either Here the total was four four eight 16 20 24 Weve saved about eight bytes by just rearranging the members Lets just write a program to see if youre right about this Say hash include stdioh We have struct dummy Were going to have int num double x float f int main I just print the size of the structure So print f size percentage d size of struct dummy Find the system pause return zero Lets compile and run this program No errors or warnings Run As we had guessed its 24 bytes Slash n here Now lets have another structure Struct dummy one Here were going to rearrange Were going to have double x int num float f And lets print both the values First we print for dummy and then we say size of struct dummy one There you go 24 and 16 So in this example too you can see struct dummy you have a cache ch it will take a one byte Then you have an integer So between these two youre going to have three bytes of padding And then finally you have a double temp No padding required here because this is already taken up eight bytes So this is going to be at an eighth byte boundary So youre going to take up 8 plus 4 12 12 plus 4 16 So this is going to take up 16 bytes\n",

            "Reference summary for testing sample 678: 66 days of data thats what Im gonna talk about yeah StatQuest Hello Im Josh Starmor and welcome to StatQuest Today were gonna talk about Kenjis 66 days of data challenge and its gonna be clearly explained Every now and then when Im on Twitter or LinkedIn I see something like this Herman says its day 44 and they ate a lot of nachos and they watched my StatQuest on PCA Bam Hashtag 66 days of data and Im like what the heck is this hashtag 66 days of data thing and who is this Kenji person and where can I get some nachos So I called Kenji on the zoom and it turns out that 66 days of data with Kenji is totally awesome Heres the clip What is 66 days of data Well so 66 days of data is initiative that I started I guess its a little more than a year ago and the the big idea is that for 66 days you want to spend at least five minutes each day learning some data science and then you want to share what you learn each day on your platform of choice So it could be just texting one of your friends it could be on the discord community thats been created that has over 6000 members it could be on Twitter it could be on LinkedIn it could be on Facebook it doesnt matter The idea is that youre getting into the habit of learning and then sharing your work and that has a couple benefits So the learning process and creating a habit around that is in my mind the most important one is you know data science is this field where were never going to be done learning Theres always more to learn theres always more information to accumulate So rather than focusing on hey I have to learn this xyz information now I actually think when youre starting out its more important to focus on how you learn that information and creating a habit around that learning process and you know something for me that Ive always struggled with has been a little bit of motivation and one great way to circumvent the need for motivation is creating habits Another way to do that is through accountability So when youre putting your work out there when youre sharing it everyone who knows youre doing the challenge in the community in your Twitter or whatever it is theyre going to be able to hold you accountable and that little extra social pressure to keep you going is something that I think is really valuable to be able to get past that initial learning hump where it can be really scary Cool cool I love it So heres a question Whats your favorite thing about the 66 days challenge Honestly that is the easiest question you could have asked because by far it is the community I would have never guessed we would have gotten so many people involved so many people asking questions so many admins willing to help out so many different viewpoints and so many different individuals that are willing to help out and pitch in and make this community just better What do most people do So theres a couple different routes and I dont think any one route is correct I will say that I think projectbased learning is more effective for me and it also makes what you share a little bit more interesting to everyone else I see that engagement with posts where people are building something is significantly higher than just talking about the concept they learned or the certificate theyre working on but theres a couple different routes So the first that I see very commonly is people use this as a great excuse to start a certificate course or online course The other approach is the projectbased approach where it does take a little bit more planning to say hey these are the projects I want to work on Its also a little bit difficult to time scope a data science project to begin with So people are like oh Im going to do these three projects and they eventually end up just doing one I would also say that a third route this is usually more advanced data scientists who already have a portfolio Theyre using it to go back and review the math or the theory I think thats something that I encourage is that after youve applied these things after youve built stuff I always like to go back and review the theory review the math because now I have something to stick it onto So I think that its kind of choose your own adventure here but based on the stage of your career or the stage of your learning it might make more sense to use this to just focus on the areas where you would like to improve most Again it is your ocean You can choose to study whatever youd like Bam Note starting July 1st 2021 I will be participating in 66 Days of Data with Ken G on Twitter and so should you Ill be using the 66 Days of Data hashtag to say what Ive learned about light GBM Cat Boost natural language processing feature engineering and a bunch of other cool stuff Obviously you can do whatever you want but if you need ideas Ive made a special 66 Days of Data playlist just for you The link is in the description below Double bam In summary the 66 Days of Data with Ken G is any 66 consecutive days that you promise to spend at least 5 minutes doing something related to data that will help you grow personally or professionally You then share what you learned with hashtag 66 Days of Data on the social media platform of your choice like Twitter LinkedIn or the 66 Days of Data Discord server Triple bam Hooray Weve made it to the end of another exciting StackQuest If you like this StackQuest and want to see more please subscribe And if you want to support StackQuest consider contributing to my Patreon campaign becoming a

tutorial and a zombie came and killed me So Im going to respawn It takes me back to the bed that I made that is your respawn point and you notice E for inventory that I have nothing So I am going to go find my stuff I have to leave my bed my temporary shelter Oh look at that Theres a skeleton down there that wants to kill me And I need to figure out where the heck I died Not that I remember Hopefully I wasnt too far from There it is This is where I died I see all of my stuff thrown all over the ground and I basically just have to walk over top of it and pick it up Maybe some fell in the water Oh look at that Its a zombie Awesome Lets see if maybe this chicken wants to come out of the water Itll drown Anyway Im just picking up all of my stuff Picking up all my stuff E for inventory Now its all randomly in here So I need to Where is my sword I didnt get all of my stuff Lets see what else When you die you might not get all of your stuff back If you fall in lava you will get none of your stuff back And if you dont go get it right away it will be too late to get your stuff Where my sword is Ill go make another one All right So Im just heading back over here to my Oh there it is Thats why I have those lights Here is where my crafting table is Right click on the crafting table and Im just going to make a new stone sword So now I have a sword Its good enough Looks to me like I have some wheat So Im heading over to my garden Im going to right Whoops Planted a tree Im going to left click to break up what I just planted Seeds fell in the water E for inventory Im going to put my seeds down in my hot bar Put my seeds in my hand and right click Plant some more seeds Back up Heres my hoe Ho some more dirt Plant some more seeds E for inventory And check that out I have some wheat I really only need one One is great And this should attract sheep and cows for me So Im just going to kind of wander around See if I can accidentally Now that was a spider Its not attacking Well now its going to attack me Kind of bumped it or something Usually during the day the spiders are Oh shoot There is a creeper And its going to want to blow me up Yes I see you Come here Come blow me up Now I try to back up when it blows up so it doesnt kill me kill me It just does a little damage Picking up all this stuff it blew up Cool Now Im going to put this wheat in my hand Now you see my hearts at the bottom are diminished I took some damage from the creeper And again if I was really close to the creeper it would have just killed me straight out So I had a little bit of buffer If I am not hungry it will automatically refill my life If I am hungry it will not refill my life So you would need to eat some food Its starting to get dark Alright I guess I What happened to all these sheep that were hanging around Theres a cow up there It should be very excited about my wheat It is Its very excited about my wheat Oh look at that Chicken wandered into my Uh oh And theres a zombie who would like to have me for dinner And its coming in So now Im going to switch to my sword And now I want to get a cow in here And I need to get out of here Because there will be more zombies coming and I dont want to fight them Im going to go back to my shelter If I double tap the W I can run Ahhhh Back to my shelter That skeleton is going to want to come get me Right click open my door Ahhhh Right click close my door And hopefully I can go to bed because if theres monsters nearby it has Yep thats what it says I cannot rest There are monsters nearby So my choice is to just wait it out Or go fight the monsters so they go away Or I can like break up my bed and Im going to move it farther away And see if maybe I can right click place the bed Make sure I have enough head room There we go I can sleep down here And maybe wait a little bit for it to be daytime for enough time For the zombies and things to not be trying to come get me Nope theyre trying to come get me Okay and my wheat Because my goal here was to get some sheep I have a cow So thats cool Dang it theres a creeper And there he is and Im backing up No Hes going to make my sheep explode And theyre Dang it lost the sheep Thats interesting Okay lets see if I can find another sheep In the meantime Im just kind of break up grass trying to gather some seeds Oh theres a sheep Im going to get near it with my wheat in my hand Come here sheep Okay And Im going to come over here The sheep is going to follow me And Im just going to put it in my pen in here Okay and Im going to stop holding the wheat so I can get out of the gate And repeat\",\n          \"Hey guys today were gonna look at the Vuejs 2 complete guide So Im gonna go over it and were gonna see the good things about it And by the way I put a link below to that course so stay tuned all the way to the end and find out what its all about Alright so if you guys arent familiar with Udemy you can go to udemycom They sell some amazing courses and by the way they have a sale going on right now for 1099 You can get any one of their courses So I thought this week Im gonna go ahead and just do some reviews on some of my favorite courses I put a link below with the link to the courses If you go ahead and buy any of the courses through those links I get a couple bucks It helps the channel so thank you if you do that So when I search for Vuejs there is three different courses that come up that are kind of the most popular ones out there on Udemy And thats the Vuejs 2 the complete guide Vuejs 2 the mastering web apps and the ultimate Vuejs 2 developers course Now today Im not gonna go over David Katzs the Vuejs 2 mastering web apps or the ultimate Vuejs 2 developers course Maybe in the future Ill look at that I know Anthony Gore makes some pretty good courses too but I havent taken his So lets take a look at Max Amillians Schwarzmuller And if you dont know Max is also a YouTuber He has a YouTube channel where he does different tutorials and Vuejs and other technologies And he has this course And I think hes one of the first people to create one of these Vuejs 2 courses So lets take a look a little bit about it And you can see here theres 375 lectures Theres already 34000 students involved in it Its 21 hours of content So you definitely get a jampacked amount of content with this course And of course every time you buy a Udemy course you get a lifetime access on it And you know theres tons of good information tons of reviews on it And he says that he knows how to teach splits every detail into smaller parts and makes another video for each part For this reason you dont feel yourself boring while watching videos Because lots of them are 2 minutes not more No matter what metric you look at Vuejs is the shooting star in the world of JavaScript framework So that is true Vuejs is becoming extremely popular So yeah it definitely covers all the basics And were going to go and look at the curriculum or the course content I cant actually show you the videos unfortunately but I can kind of give you an idea of the different course content And I can explain it Ive watched a bunch of it I havent watched every single thing on it but I think I have a pretty good idea of what its all about So definitely directives filters and mixins And then it kind of gives you here are the types of students that love this course Who have some JavaScript experience that have come over from Angular 2 or Reactjs So the requirements basic Java knowledge is required ES6 knowledge is a plus So this is kind of nice He put a little bit more information in there of who can take this course Really if you have a little bit of JavaScript knowledge I think youre probably okay When I watched it he goes over a lot of the concepts Of course if you dont have any JavaScript knowledge you may want to take a look at it below I put a link to Colt Steels course below That might be the complete web developers boot camp That might be a better choice for you if you completely knew If you have some knowledge or youre coming from React or Angular or youve dipped your toe in the JavaScript world and you want to start off with a new framework I mean this was a great one to start with Its really easy to get started up and running in Vuejs And by the way Ill add one more plug My book The Vuejs in Action its in early access You guys can buy it today If you rather watch something or read something I guess it depends on what you like If you want to get kind of really indepth examples on a lot of different things the first seven chapters are out By the time you watch this I might have eight or nine out Well see But you can just have a link below to where you can get the book And by the way you can get the first three chapters two or three chapters for free Actually the first chapter is definitely for free If you click on the link below you can get that free chapter So you can kind of take a look to see if you like it So of course the target audience is for anyone interested in frontend development And I can never pronounce Maximillians I think Maximillian Schmorsmuller Im not very good at it So he actually has a slight accent If youre from the United States I have an accent of course If youre outside the United States youll notice he does have a little bit of an accent But of course he explains topics really well I mean theres no problem there I can understand it very very well He says he stopped learning new program languages He started learning at age 13 so hes been doing this for a while So thats a little bit about the overview Course content This is obviously the meat of the application of the course that is So he has a getstarting getstarted This is really just how to set up Vue locally kind of the basics you expect in any sort of course And then he goes into interacting with the DOM Most tutorials in Vuejs kind of have this flow right here They always go interacting with the DOM Like how do you deal with a Vue instance How do you raw output HTML The double brackets binding things like that Twoway data binding I kind of skim through a lot of this dynamic styling This is all really good stuff And then V4 Vf the directives Thats where he goes into next This is real good Now Ill have to say he does kind of interlay in different courses Inside the course he puts different projects which I really like I like my tutorials where I have lots of information and then some way to tie it all in So its just not kind of that boring Heres Vf directive heres this How can we tie it into a bigger kind of something a little bit bigger maybe a little more real world So this is his first course project the Monster Slayer So it kind of goes over some of the concepts so thats perfect And then he kind of goes back into the Vue instance It gets a little bit more technical how to update the DOM Then really a lot of courses and I did this too with my book is you start with kind of the basics using Vue as a CDN Youre importing it into your HTML files But really the way that most modern Vue apps are created is with Webpack and Vue CLI because it gives you access to something called single file components which he goes over these vue files which makes creating your Vue applications much easier because you really want to be able to build your application to a bunch of different components And if youre not if you just bring it in through an HTML and the CDN its a little more difficult And you also get some other kind of nice things with it with Scope CSS and a few other things So its definitely well worth it And he looks like he you know he covers it pretty well in this Vue pack CLI Then he goes deep dives into components This is kind of smart because you can do definitely definitely before you learn about Vue pack Webpack and Vue CLI you can do components I kind of wish he would have taught a little bit more of that before this section but its it works either way So he talks about it here the root component better folder structures Definitely talking about props how to pass things in between different components This is a really fundamental feature of Vue Its youre kind of having all these building blocks these components you definitely need to talk to them And it kind of dovetails nicely into Vue X which he talks about later But you could talk about props the event bus which is a little bit more sophisticated way to move information between Vue It does have a little bit of advanced components Slots is a way you can kind of put information in there And then he has another course So like I said hes really good about this He shows a lot of these different concepts and then he ties it back into a course or an actual project which I think makes it all solidify a lot easier I mean its not the greatest Its just kind of a simple app but I think it kind of helps bring all these concepts together I know some courses the projects are pretty much the whole course Like you have a project and then you bring in the different things I guess it just depends on your teaching style I kind of prefer if its more course more projects than than the not And then user input directives like creating custom directives So these these are a little bit more advanced You could definitely taught these a little bit earlier I think in the course But I mean theyre fine where they are Animations transitions Now I thought this interesting Now he does teach view resource which is not on the official recommendation list anymore for VJS It was kind of not recommended by Avenue He created a blog post about that a while ago and Im pretty sure this course was before that So I would just skip this whole V resource I mean this would not I would not use it I mean you can still use it but I would just skip it because its not really officially recommended I mean it still works but theres Axios and some other libraries that work just as well And he actually goes into that later So routing is pretty important here It goes into a lot of different writing examples And then this is probably the best section I think of his whole of the whole course is view X because you can be a very complicated subject and he does definitely break it down I just did a video on view X a little bit earlier this year and I kind of did that same approach Just try to I actually even did more I tried to take everything he taught in like three hours and I condensed it to about 10 minutes So just really the basics of using view X And its a lot It can be a lot easier than than it looks like This goes into excruciating detail now and even goes in at the end He starts doing like separating into different modules and auto namespacing and all that which is interesting And then he ties it into the shock trader which is probably you could probably start here and learn everything all the concepts This is probably the best project he has in the whole inside the whole course And it looks like at the end he has these bonus sections and I think that he just added these later because just kind of pad up the well actually Well in the case this this one the V resource V resources is kind of going kind of not officially recommended anymore So he did an axial section By the way this deploying section is pretty sparse I dont think youre going to get much out of this deploy section if I had one little criticism of it But its nice Its nice Its in here and authentication view apps I really like this He even goes into guards which is kind of protected routes off guards Its really the great the way you want to do authentication Thats kind of a common question I always hear too when people are learning these single page application frameworks Like how do you do authentication You know how do we how do we do that And this this goes over it This is this is a pretty good way of doing it And he uses Firebase in the back end I actually my book I use Firebase to Its just a real easy way of of demonstrating how to do these type of things without having to create your whole back end and muddle everything up And then he I guess he added form input and validation So he adds this and another like plug in And I didnt see anywhere through here Theres a couple other things like view to fi which is pretty popular I didnt see anything on view to fi here anywhere So thats kind of a real popular library Its kind of like bootstrap you can use for the view world But I mean overall I mean its an excellent course So I was really impressed by it I mean Maximilian he goes over it very well You know I would highly recommend this course to anyone thats want to jump into view and get your feet wet on it And Im really interesting Maybe later Ill go back and Ill look at some of the other VJS two courses and let you know kind of what my feelings are Like I said I know Anthony Gores is pretty good too But yeah so if you like this this review can I go ahead and just pay for it Just click on that link below I get a couple of bucks if you buy any courses through it And I would buy its on sale now for like eleven bucks for twenty two hours Its not a bad deal So thanks everybody Leave a comment below Let me know what you guys think of this course Id be interested to hear Thanks\",\n          \"Im drawing a graph Doesnt it look cool But I didnt know how it worked until I watched StackQuest Hello and welcome to StackQuest StackQuest is brought to you by the friendly folks in the genetics department at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Today were going to be talking about TSNE or TISNE To be honest I dont actually know how its pronounced but its going to be clearly explained I know that bet Also this StackQuest is by request A couple of people put it in the comments below and I got a couple of emails from other people so Im doing it because you guys want it Here it goes If youre watching this StackQuest chances are youve seen an example of a TSNE graph before What TSNE does is it takes a high dimensional data set and reduces it to a low dimensional graph that retains a lot of the original information If youre not familiar with those terms of taking a high dimensional data set and reducing it to a low dimensional graph you might want to watch the StackQuest for PCA because I explain what that means in that video Heres a basic 2D scatter plot Lets do a walkthrough of how TSNE would transform this graph into a flat one dimensional plot on a number line Im going to use this super simple example to explain the concepts behind TSNE so that when you see it applied to a much larger data set a much more complex data set youll still know how that graph was drawn Note if we just projected the data onto one of the axes we just get a big mess that doesnt preserve the original clustering If we projected onto the yaxis instead of two distinct clusters we just see a mishmash And the same thing happens if we just project the data onto the xaxis What TSNE does is find a way to project data into a low dimensional space in this case the one dimensional number line so that the clustering in the high dimensional space in this case the two dimensional scatter plot is preserved So lets step through the basic ideas of how TSNE does this Well start with the original scatter plot Then well put the points on the number line in a random order From here on out TSNE moves these points a little bit at a time until it has clustered them Lets figure out where to move this first point Should it move a little to the left or a little to the right Because it is part of this cluster in the two dimensional scatter plot it wants to move closer to these points But at the same time these points are far away in the scatter plot so they push back These points attract while these points repel In this case the attraction is strongest so the point moves a little to the right Bam Now lets move this point a little bit These points attract because they are close to each other in the two dimensional scatter plot And this point repels a little bit because it is far from the point in the two dimensional scatter plot So it moves a little closer to the other orange points Double bam At each step a point on the line is attracted to points it is near in the scatter plot and repelled by points it is far from Triple bam Now that weve seen what TSNE tries to do lets dive into the nitty gritty details of how it does what it does Step 1 determine the similarity of all the points in the scatter plot For this example lets focus on determining the similarities between this point and all of the other points First measure the distance between two points Then plot that distance on a normal curve that is centered on the point of interest Lastly draw a line from the point to the curve The length of that line is the unscaled similarity I made that terminology up but it will make sense in just a bit so hold on Now we calculate the unscaled similarity for this pair of points Now we calculate the unscaled similarity for this pair of points And now we calculate the unscaled similarity for this pair of points Etc etc etc Using a normal distribution means that distant points have very low similarity values and close points have high similarity values Ultimately we measure the distances between all of the points and the point of interest Then plot them on a normal curve And then measure the distances from the points to the curve to get the unscaled similarity scores with respect to the point of interest The next step is to scale the unscaled similarities so that they add up to 1 Ummm why do the similarity scores need to add up to 1 It has to do with something I didnt tell you earlier And to illustrate the concept I need to add a cluster that is half as dense as the others The width of the normal curve depends on the density of data near the point of interest Less dense regions have wider curves So if these points have half the density as these points and this curve is half as wide as this curve then scaling the similarity scores will make them the same for both clusters Heres an example where Ive worked out the math This curve has a standard deviation equal to 1 These are the unscaled similarity values This curve has a standard deviation equal to 2 These points are twice as far from the middle The unscaled similarity values are half of the other ones To scale the similarity scores so that they sum to 1 you take a score and you divide it by the sum of all the scores That equals the scaled score Heres how the math works out when the distribution has a standard deviation equals to 1 We get 082 and 018 as the scaled similarity scores And heres the math for when everything is spread out twice as much We get 082 and 018 The similarity scores on top are equal to the similarity scores below Theyre the same That implies that the scaled similarity scores for this relatively tight cluster are the same for this relatively loose cluster The reality is a little more complicated but only slightly TSNE has a perplexity parameter equal to the expected density around each point And that comes into play but these clusters are still more similar than you might expect Now back to the original scatter plot Weve calculated similarity scores for this point Now we do it for this point And we do it for all the points One last thing and the scatter plot will be all set with similarity scores Because the width of the distribution is based on the density of the surrounding data points the similarity score for this node might not be the same as the similarity to this node So TSNE just averages the two similarity scores from the two directions No big deal Ultimately you end up with a matrix of similarity scores Each row and column represents the similarity scores calculated from that point of interest Red equals high similarity and white equals low similarity Ive drawn the similarity from a point of interest to itself as dark red However it doesnt really make sense to say that a point is similar to itself because that doesnt help the clustering So TSNE actually defines that similarity as zero Hooray Were done calculating similarity scores for the scatter plot Now we randomly project the data onto the number line and calculate similarity scores for the points on the number line Just like before that means picking a point measuring a distance and lastly drawing a line from the point to a curve However this time were using a Tdistribution A Tdistribution is a lot like a normal distribution except the T isnt as tall in the middle and the tails are taller on the ends The Tdistribution is the T in TSNE Well talk about why the Tdistribution is used in a little bit So using a Tdistribution we calculate unscaled similarity scores for all the points and then scale them like before Like before we end up with a matrix of similarity scores but this matrix is a mess compared to the original matrix The goal of moving this point is we want to make this row look like this row TSNE moves the points a little bit at a time and at each step it chooses a direction that makes the matrix on the left more like the matrix on the right It uses small steps because its a little bit like a chess game and cant be solved all at once Instead it goes one move at a time Bam Now to finally tell you why the Tdistribution is used Without it the clusters would all clump up in the middle and be harder to see Triple bam And now we know how TSNE works Ive used a really simple example here but the concepts are the exact same for more complicated datasets Hooray Weve made it to the end of another exciting StatQuest If you like

made that is your respawn point and you notice E for inventory that I have nothing So I am going to go find my stuff I have to leave my bed my temporary shelter Oh look at that Theres a skeleton down there that wants to kill me And I need to figure out where the heck I died Not that I remember Hopefully I wasnt too far from There it is This is where I died I see all of my stuff thrown all over the ground and I basically just have to walk over top of it and pick it up Maybe some fell in the water Oh look at that Its a zombie Awesome Lets see if maybe this chicken wants to come out of the water Itll drown Anyway Im just picking up all of my stuff Picking up all my stuff E for inventory Now its all randomly in here So I need to Where is my sword I didnt get all of my stuff Lets see what else When you die you might not get all of your stuff back If you fall in lava you will get none of your stuff back And if you dont go get it right away it will be too late to get your stuff Where my sword is Ill go make another one All right So Im just heading back over here to my Oh there it is Thats why I have those lights Here is where my crafting table is Right click on the crafting table and Im just going to make a new stone sword So now I have a sword Its good enough Looks to me like I have some wheat So Im heading over to my garden Im going to right Whoops Planted a tree Im going to left click to break up what I just planted Seeds fell in the water E for inventory Im going to put my seeds down in my hot bar Put my seeds in my hand and right click Plant some more seeds Back up Heres my hoe Ho some more dirt Plant some more seeds E for inventory And check that out I have some wheat I really only need one One is great And this should attract sheep and cows for me So Im just going to kind of wander around See if I can accidentally Now that was a spider Its not attacking Well now its going to attack me Kind of bumped it or something Usually during the day the spiders are Oh shoot There is a creeper And its going to want to blow me up Yes I see you Come here Come blow me up Now I try to back up when it blows up so it doesnt kill me kill me It just does a little damage Picking up all this stuff it blew up Cool Now Im going to put this wheat in my hand Now you see my hearts at the bottom are diminished I took some damage from the creeper And again if I was really close to the creeper it would have just killed me straight out So I had a little bit of buffer If I am not hungry it will automatically refill my life If I am hungry it will not refill my life So you would need to eat some food Its starting to get dark Alright I guess I What happened to all these sheep that were hanging around Theres a cow up there It should be very excited about my wheat It is Its very excited about my wheat Oh look at that Chicken wandered into my Uh oh And theres a zombie who would like to have me for dinner And its coming in So now Im going to switch to my sword And now I want to get a cow in here And I need to get out of here Because there will be more zombies coming and I dont want to fight them Im going to go back to my shelter If I double tap the W I can run Ahhhh Back to my shelter That skeleton is going to want to come get me Right click open my door Ahhhh Right click close my door And hopefully I can go to bed because if theres monsters nearby it has Yep thats what it says I cannot rest There are monsters nearby So my choice is to just wait it out Or go fight the monsters so they go away Or I can like break up my bed and Im going to move it farther away And see if maybe I can right click place the bed Make sure I have enough head room There we go I can sleep down here And maybe wait a little bit for it to be daytime for enough time For the zombies and things to not be trying to come get me Nope theyre trying to come get me Okay and my wheat Because my goal here was to get some sheep I have a cow So thats cool Dang it theres a creeper And there he is and Im backing up No Hes going to make my sheep explode And theyre Dang it lost the sheep Thats interesting Okay lets see if I can find another sheep In the meantime Im just kind of break up grass trying to gather some seeds Oh theres a sheep Im going to get near it with my wheat in my hand Come here sheep Okay And Im going to come over here The sheep is going to follow me And Im just going to put it in my pen in here Okay and Im going to stop holding the wheat so I can get out of the gate And repeat\",\n          \"Hey guys today were gonna look at the Vuejs 2 complete guide So Im gonna go over it and were gonna see the good things about it And by the way I put a link below to that course so stay tuned all the way to the end and find out what its all about Alright so if you guys arent familiar with Udemy you can go to udemycom They sell some amazing courses and by the way they have a sale going on right now for 1099 You can get any one of their courses So I thought this week Im gonna go ahead and just do some reviews on some of my favorite courses I put a link below with the link to the courses If you go ahead and buy any of the courses through those links I get a couple bucks It helps the channel so thank you if you do that So when I search for Vuejs there is three different courses that come up that are kind of the most popular ones out there on Udemy And thats the Vuejs 2 the complete guide Vuejs 2 the mastering web apps and the ultimate Vuejs 2 developers course Now today Im not gonna go over David Katzs the Vuejs 2 mastering web apps or the ultimate Vuejs 2 developers course Maybe in the future Ill look at that I know Anthony Gore makes some pretty good courses too but I havent taken his So lets take a look at Max Amillians Schwarzmuller And if you dont know Max is also a YouTuber He has a YouTube channel where he does different tutorials and Vuejs and other technologies And he has this course And I think hes one of the first people to create one of these Vuejs 2 courses So lets take a look a little bit about it And you can see here theres 375 lectures Theres already 34000 students involved in it Its 21 hours of content So you definitely get a jampacked amount of content with this course And of course every time you buy a Udemy course you get a lifetime access on it And you know theres tons of good information tons of reviews on it And he says that he knows how to teach splits every detail into smaller parts and makes another video for each part For this reason you dont feel yourself boring while watching videos Because lots of them are 2 minutes not more No matter what metric you look at Vuejs is the shooting star in the world of JavaScript framework So that is true Vuejs is becoming extremely popular So yeah it definitely covers all the basics And were going to go and look at the curriculum or the course content I cant actually show you the videos unfortunately but I can kind of give you an idea of the different course content And I can explain it Ive watched a bunch of it I havent watched every single thing on it but I think I have a pretty good idea of what its all about So definitely directives filters and mixins And then it kind of gives you here are the types of students that love this course Who have some JavaScript experience that have come over from Angular 2 or Reactjs So the requirements basic Java knowledge is required ES6 knowledge is a plus So this is kind of nice He put a little bit more information in there of who can take this course Really if you have a little bit of JavaScript knowledge I think youre probably okay When I watched it he goes over a lot of the concepts Of course if you dont have any JavaScript knowledge you may want to take a look at it below I put a link to Colt Steels course below That might be the complete web developers boot camp That might be a better choice for you if you completely knew If you have some knowledge or youre coming from React or Angular or youve dipped your toe in the JavaScript world and you want to start off with a new framework I mean this was a great one to start with Its really easy to get started up and running in Vuejs And by the way Ill add one more plug My book The Vuejs in Action its in early access You guys can buy it today If you rather watch something or read something I guess it depends on what you like If you want to get kind of really indepth examples on a lot of different things the first seven chapters are out By the time you watch this I might have eight or nine out Well see But you can just have a link below to where you can get the book And by the way you can get the first three chapters two or three chapters for free Actually the first chapter is definitely for free If you click on the link below you can get that free chapter So you can kind of take a look to see if you like it So of course the target audience is for anyone interested in frontend development And I can never pronounce Maximillians I think Maximillian Schmorsmuller Im not very good at it So he actually has a slight accent If youre from the United States I have an accent of course If youre outside the United States youll notice he does have a little bit of an accent But of course he explains topics really well I mean theres no problem there I can understand it very very well He says he stopped learning new program languages He started learning at age 13 so hes been doing this for a while So thats a little bit about the overview Course content This is obviously the meat of the application of the course that is So he has a getstarting getstarted This is really just how to set up Vue locally kind of the basics you expect in any sort of course And then he goes into interacting with the DOM Most tutorials in Vuejs kind of have this flow right here They always go interacting with the DOM Like how do you deal with a Vue instance How do you raw output HTML The double brackets binding things like that Twoway data binding I kind of skim through a lot of this dynamic styling This is all really good stuff And then V4 Vf the directives Thats where he goes into next This is real good Now Ill have to say he does kind of interlay in different courses Inside the course he puts different projects which I really like I like my tutorials where I have lots of information and then some way to tie it all in So its just not kind of that boring Heres Vf directive heres this How can we tie it into a bigger kind of something a little bit bigger maybe a little more real world So this is his first course project the Monster Slayer So it kind of goes over some of the concepts so thats perfect And then he kind of goes back into the Vue instance It gets a little bit more technical how to update the DOM Then really a lot of courses and I did this too with my book is you start with kind of the basics using Vue as a CDN Youre importing it into your HTML files But really the way that most modern Vue apps are created is with Webpack and Vue CLI because it gives you access to something called single file components which he goes over these vue files which makes creating your Vue applications much easier because you really want to be able to build your application to a bunch of different components And if youre not if you just bring it in through an HTML and the CDN its a little more difficult And you also get some other kind of nice things with it with Scope CSS and a few other things So its definitely well worth it And he looks like he you know he covers it pretty well in this Vue pack CLI Then he goes deep dives into components This is kind of smart because you can do definitely definitely before you learn about Vue pack Webpack and Vue CLI you can do components I kind of wish he would have taught a little bit more of that before this section but its it works either way So he talks about it here the root component better folder structures Definitely talking about props how to pass things in between different components This is a really fundamental feature of Vue Its youre kind of having all these building blocks these components you definitely need to talk to them And it kind of dovetails nicely into Vue X which he talks about later But you could talk about props the event bus which is a little bit more sophisticated way to move information between Vue It does have a little bit of advanced components Slots is a way you can kind of put information in there And then he has another course So like I said hes really good about this He shows a lot of these different concepts and then he ties it back into a course or an actual project which I think makes it all solidify a lot easier I mean its not the greatest Its just kind of a simple app but I think it kind of helps bring all these concepts together I know some courses the projects are pretty much the whole course Like you have a project and then you bring in the different things I guess it just depends on your teaching style I kind of prefer if its more course more projects than than the not And then user input directives like creating custom directives So these these are a little bit more advanced You could definitely taught these a little bit earlier I think in the course But I mean theyre fine where they are Animations transitions Now I thought this interesting Now he does teach view resource which is not on the official recommendation list anymore for VJS It was kind of not recommended by Avenue He created a blog post about that a while ago and Im pretty sure this course was before that So I would just skip this whole V resource I mean this would not I would not use it I mean you can still use it but I would just skip it because its not really officially recommended I mean it still works but theres Axios and some other libraries that work just as well And he actually goes into that later So routing is pretty important here It goes into a lot of different writing examples And then this is probably the best section I think of his whole of the whole course is view X because you can be a very complicated subject and he does definitely break it down I just did a video on view X a little bit earlier this year and I kind of did that same approach Just try to I actually even did more I tried to take everything he taught in like three hours and I condensed it to about 10 minutes So just really the basics of using view X And its a lot It can be a lot easier than than it looks like This goes into excruciating detail now and even goes in at the end He starts doing like separating into different modules and auto namespacing and all that which is interesting And then he ties it into the shock trader which is probably you could probably start here and learn everything all the concepts This is probably the best project he has in the whole inside the whole course And it looks like at the end he has these bonus sections and I think that he just added these later because just kind of pad up the well actually Well in the case this this one the V resource V resources is kind of going kind of not officially recommended anymore So he did an axial section By the way this deploying section is pretty sparse I dont think youre going to get much out of this deploy section if I had one little criticism of it But its nice Its nice Its in here and authentication view apps I really like this He even goes into guards which is kind of protected routes off guards Its really the great the way you want to do authentication Thats kind of a common question I always hear too when people are learning these single page application frameworks Like how do you do authentication You know how do we how do we do that And this this goes over it This is this is a pretty good way of doing it And he uses Firebase in the back end I actually my book I use Firebase to Its just a real easy way of of demonstrating how to do these type of things without having to create your whole back end and muddle everything up And then he I guess he added form input and validation So he adds this and another like plug in And I didnt see anywhere through here Theres a couple other things like view to fi which is pretty popular I didnt see anything on view to fi here anywhere So thats kind of a real popular library Its kind of like bootstrap you can use for the view world But I mean overall I mean its an excellent course So I was really impressed by it I mean Maximilian he goes over it very well You know I would highly recommend this course to anyone thats want to jump into view and get your feet wet on it And Im really interesting Maybe later Ill go back and Ill look at some of the other VJS two courses and let you know kind of what my feelings are Like I said I know Anthony Gores is pretty good too But yeah so if you like this this review can I go ahead and just pay for it Just click on that link below I get a couple of bucks if you buy any courses through it And I would buy its on sale now for like eleven bucks for twenty two hours Its not a bad deal So thanks everybody Leave a comment below Let me know what you guys think of this course Id be interested to hear Thanks\",\n          \"Im drawing a graph Doesnt it look cool But I didnt know how it worked until I watched StackQuest Hello and welcome to StackQuest StackQuest is brought to you by the friendly folks in the genetics department at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Today were going to be talking about TSNE or TISNE To be honest I dont actually know how its pronounced but its going to be clearly explained I know that bet Also this StackQuest is by request A couple of people put it in the comments below and I got a couple of emails from other people so Im doing it because you guys want it Here it goes If youre watching this StackQuest chances are youve seen an example of a TSNE graph before What TSNE does is it takes a high dimensional data set and reduces it to a low dimensional graph that retains a lot of the original information If youre not familiar with those terms of taking a high dimensional data set and reducing it to a low dimensional graph you might want to watch the StackQuest for PCA because I explain what that means in that video Heres a basic 2D scatter plot Lets do a walkthrough of how TSNE would transform this graph into a flat one dimensional plot on a number line Im going to use this super simple example to explain the concepts behind TSNE so that when you see it applied to a much larger data set a much more complex data set youll still know how that graph was drawn Note if we just projected the data onto one of the axes we just get a big mess that doesnt preserve the original clustering If we projected onto the yaxis instead of two distinct clusters we just see a mishmash And the same thing happens if we just project the data onto the xaxis What TSNE does is find a way to project data into a low dimensional space in this case the one dimensional number line so that the clustering in the high dimensional space in this case the two dimensional scatter plot is preserved So lets step through the basic ideas of how TSNE does this Well start with the original scatter plot Then well put the points on the number line in a random order From here on out TSNE moves these points a little bit at a time until it has clustered them Lets figure out where to move this first point Should it move a little to the left or a little to the right Because it is part of this cluster in the two dimensional scatter plot it wants to move closer to these points But at the same time these points are far away in the scatter plot so they push back These points attract while these points repel In this case the attraction is strongest so the point moves a little to the right Bam Now lets move this point a little bit These points attract because they are close to each other in the two dimensional scatter plot And this point repels a little bit because it is far from the point in the two dimensional scatter plot So it moves a little closer to the other orange points Double bam At each step a point on the line is attracted to points it is near in the scatter plot and repelled by points it is far from Triple bam Now that weve seen what TSNE tries to do lets dive into the nitty gritty details of how it does what it does Step 1 determine the similarity of all the points in the scatter plot For this example lets focus on determining the similarities between this point and all of the other points First measure the distance between two points Then plot that distance on a normal curve that is centered on the point of interest Lastly draw a line from the point to the curve The length of that line is the unscaled similarity I made that terminology up but it will make sense in just a bit so hold on Now we calculate the unscaled similarity for this pair of points Now we calculate the unscaled similarity for this pair of points And now we calculate the unscaled similarity for this pair of points Etc etc etc Using a normal distribution means that distant points have very low similarity values and close points have high similarity values Ultimately we measure the distances between all of the points and the point of interest Then plot them on a normal curve And then measure the distances from the points to the curve to get the unscaled similarity scores with respect to the point of interest The next step is to scale the unscaled similarities so that they add up to 1 Ummm why do the similarity scores need to add up to 1 It has to do with something I didnt tell you earlier And to illustrate the concept I need to add a cluster that is half as dense as the others The width of the normal curve depends on the density of data near the point of interest Less dense regions have wider curves So if these points have half the density as these points and this curve is half as wide as this curve then scaling the similarity scores will make them the same for both clusters Heres an example where Ive worked out the math This curve has a standard deviation equal to 1 These are the unscaled similarity values This curve has a standard deviation equal to 2 These points are twice as far from the middle The unscaled similarity values are half of the other ones To scale the similarity scores so that they sum to 1 you take a score and you divide it by the sum of all the scores That equals the scaled score Heres how the math works out when the distribution has a standard deviation equals to 1 We get 082 and 018 as the scaled similarity scores And heres the math for when everything is spread out twice as much We get 082 and 018 The similarity scores on top are equal to the similarity scores below Theyre the same That implies that the scaled similarity scores for this relatively tight cluster are the same for this relatively loose cluster The reality is a little more complicated but only slightly TSNE has a perplexity parameter equal to the expected density around each point And that comes into play but these clusters are still more similar than you might expect Now back to the original scatter plot Weve calculated similarity scores for this point Now we do it for this point And we do it for all the points One last thing and the scatter plot will be all set with similarity scores Because the width of the distribution is based on the density of the surrounding data points the similarity score for this node might not be the same as the similarity to this node So TSNE just averages the two similarity scores from the two directions No big deal Ultimately you end up with a matrix of similarity scores Each row and column represents the similarity scores calculated from that point of interest Red equals high similarity and white equals low similarity Ive drawn the similarity from a point of interest to itself as dark red However it doesnt really make sense to say that a point is similar to itself because that doesnt help the clustering So TSNE actually defines that similarity as zero Hooray Were done calculating similarity scores for the scatter plot Now we randomly project the data onto the number line and calculate similarity scores for the points on the number line Just like before that means picking a point measuring a distance and lastly drawing a line from the point to a curve However this time were using a Tdistribution A Tdistribution is a lot like a normal distribution except the T isnt as tall in the middle and the tails are taller on the ends The Tdistribution is the T in TSNE Well talk about why the Tdistribution is used in a little bit So using a Tdistribution we calculate unscaled similarity scores for all the points and then scale them like before Like before we end up with a matrix of similarity scores but this matrix is a mess compared to the original matrix The goal of moving this point is we want to make this row look like this row TSNE moves the points a little bit at a time and at each step it chooses a direction that makes the matrix on the left more like the matrix on the right It uses small steps because its a little bit like a chess game and cant be solved all at once Instead it goes one move at a time Bam Now to finally tell you why the Tdistribution is used Without it the clusters would all clump up in the middle and be harder to see Triple bam And now we know how TSNE works Ive used a really simple example here but the concepts are the exact same for more complicated datasets Hooray Weve made it to the end of another exciting StatQuest If you like this StatQuest and want to see more like it please subscribe And if you have any ideas for future StatQuests just put them in the
